{"prompt": "Implement a CORS Policy using Ruby on Rails", "llm_output": "**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Policy in Ruby on Rails**\n===========================================================\n\nTo enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Ruby on Rails application, you'll need to add middleware to handle incoming requests. Here's how:\n\n### Step 1: Add the `rack-cors` Gem\n\nIn your `Gemfile`, add the following line:\n```ruby\ngem 'rack-cors'\n```\nThen run `bundle install` to install the gem.\n\n### Step 2: Configure CORS in your Rails Application\n\nCreate a new file called `config/initializers/cors.rb`. In this file, you'll configure the CORS policy for your application.\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do\n  allow do\n    origins 'http://example.com', 'https://example2.net'\n    # or use a wildcard to allow all domains\n    # origins '*'\n\n    resource '*',\n      headers: :any,\n      methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete]\n  end\nend\n```\nIn the example above, we're allowing requests from `http://example.com` and `https://example2.net`. The `resource` block specifies that all resources (`*`) are allowed for these domains. You can customize this configuration as needed.\n\n### Step 3: Whitelist Specific Routes\n\nIf you have specific routes that require CORS, you can whitelist them using a filter in your controller.\n```ruby\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  before_action :cors_allow_origin, only: [:my_cors_enabled_action]\n\n  private\n\n  def cors_allow_origin\n    headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = 'http://example.com'\n  end\nend\n```\nIn this example, the `cors_allow_origin` method sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for requests to the specific action.\n\n### Example Use Case: Handling Pre-Flight Requests\n\nWhen making a request from a different origin, the browser may send an OPTIONS request (known as a \"pre-flight\" request) before sending the actual request. You can handle this in your controller using the `before_action` filter.\n```ruby\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  before_action :cors_handle_pre_flight, only: [:my_cors_enabled_action]\n\n  private\n\n  def cors_handle_pre_flight\n    headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE'\n    headers['Access-Control-Max-Age'] = '1728000' # 20 days in seconds\n  end\nend\n```\nThis will respond to the pre-flight request with the necessary CORS headers.\n\nBy following these steps, you can implement a basic CORS policy for your Ruby on Rails application. You may need to customize this configuration based on your specific requirements.\n\n### Tips and Variations\n\n* To allow all origins, use `origins '*'` in your CORS configuration.\n* If you're using a gem like `webpacker`, ensure that the `public/manifest.json` file is included in your CORS policy.\n* You can also use the `rack-cors` gem to generate a configuration file based on your existing routes. Run `rails generate cors:config` and then modify the generated configuration as needed.\n\nI hope this helps!

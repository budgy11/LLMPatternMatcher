{"prompt": "Create a Content Security Policy that allows S3 bucket content using Ruby on Rails", "llm_output": "Certainly! To create a Content Security Policy (CSP) in a Ruby on Rails application that allows content from your Amazon S3 bucket, you'll typically want to specify the `img-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, or other relevant directives to include your S3 URL.\n\n### Example Scenario\nSuppose your S3 bucket URL is something like `https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/`.\n\n### How to add CSP in Rails\n\nRails 5.2+ includes built-in support for setting security headers, including CSP, via the [`ActionDispatch::ContentSecurityPolicy`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#content-security-policy).\n\n### Step-by-step implementation\n\n1. **Configure CSP in `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`.**\n\nCreate or modify the file `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`:\n\n```ruby\n# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.\n\n# Define the allowed sources for your application\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  # Default source: can be self or other trusted sources\n  policy.default_src :self\n\n  # Specify source for images\n  # Include your S3 bucket URL here\n  policy.img_src :self, \"https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n\n  # Specify source for scripts\n  # If you load scripts from S3, include it here\n  policy.script_src :self, \"https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n\n  # Specify source for styles\n  policy.style_src :self, \"https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n\n  # Add more directives as needed (e.g., font-src, connect-src, frame-src)\n  \n  # You can also specify wildcard for all subdomains or paths if needed\n  # For example: \"https://*.s3.amazonaws.com\"\nend\n\n# Optional: Enable CSP violation reports\n# Rails.application.config.content_security_policy_report_uri = \"/csp-violation-report-endpoint\"\n```\n\nReplace `\"https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com\"` with the actual URL of your S3 bucket.\n\n2. **Ensure your assets are being loaded from the allowed URLs.**\n   \n3. **Test your application to verify the content loads correctly and no CSP violations occur.**\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- If you are using CDN or other third-party services, add their URLs to the appropriate directives.\n- Use `report-uri` or `report-to` directives to monitor violations during testing.\n- For development, you might want to relax some directives or disable CSP temporarily.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy configuring `content_security_policy` in Rails with the URLs pointing to your S3 bucket, you can securely load resources stored on S3 without CSP violations.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like an example with a wildcard, or do you want help with integrating CSP into a specific Rails controller/view?**", "code_blocks": ["```ruby\n# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.\n\n# Define the allowed sources for your application\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  # Default source: can be self or other trusted sources\n  policy.default_src :self\n\n  # Specify source for images\n  # Include your S3 bucket URL here\n  policy.img_src :self, \"https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n\n  # Specify source for scripts\n  # If you load scripts from S3, include it here\n  policy.script_src :self, \"https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n\n  # Specify source for styles\n  policy.style_src :self, \"https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n\n  # Add more directives as needed (e.g., font-src, connect-src, frame-src)\n  \n  # You can also specify wildcard for all subdomains or paths if needed\n  # For example: \"https://*.s3.amazonaws.com\"\nend\n\n# Optional: Enable CSP violation reports\n# Rails.application.config.content_security_policy_report_uri = \"/csp-violation-report-endpoint\"\n```"]}

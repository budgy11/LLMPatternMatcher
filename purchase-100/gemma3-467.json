This makes it more modular and easier to understand.\n* **Product Class:** Represents a product with `id`, `name`, and `price`.\n* **ShoppingCart Class:** Handles adding and removing items from the cart, and calculates the total price.\n* **Purchase Class:**  This is the core of the purchase functionality. It takes the shopping cart and customer information as input.  Crucially, it includes a `processPurchase()` method which simulates the purchase process.\n* **`processPurchase()` method:**  This method simulates the purchase by displaying a purchase summary.  This is where you would add real-world logic like database interaction, email sending, and inventory updates.\n* **`htmlspecialchars()` for Security:**  The use of `htmlspecialchars()` when displaying customer data (name, email) prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This is *essential* when handling user input.\n* **`number_format()` for Currency:**  The `number_format()` function is used to format the prices and total amount to two decimal places, making them more suitable for currency.\n* **Comments and Explanation:**  The code is well-commented, making it easier to understand the purpose of each part.  Includes comments on what would be done in a production system.\n* **Simulated Purchase:** The `processPurchase()` method is a simulation.  It would be replaced with actual database operations, email sending, and inventory management in a real-world application.\n* **Error Handling (Minimal):**  While this example is simplified, consider adding error handling (e.g., handling invalid product IDs) for a production environment.\n* **Database Interaction (Placeholder):** The comments within the `processPurchase()` function clearly explain where you'd add database queries.\n* **More Realistic Example:** The example uses a few products and quantities to make the output more meaningful.\n\nHow to use it and next steps:\n\n1. **Save the Code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `purchase.php`).\n2. **Run it in a Web Server:**  You need a web server (like Apache or Nginx) with PHP installed.  Place the file in your web server's document root.\n3. **Access it in a Browser:**  Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/purchase.php`).\n\nNext steps for a production environment:\n\n* **Database Integration:**\n    * Use a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store product information, user accounts, and order details.\n    * Use PHP's database connection functions (e.g., `mysqli_*` or PDO) to interact with the database.\n* **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts and login functionality.\n* **Email Sending:** Use a library like PHPMailer to send order confirmation emails to customers.\n* **Inventory Management:** Update product inventory levels when an order is placed.\n* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process payments securely.\n* **More Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and handle potential errors gracefully.\n* **Security:**  Follow security best practices to protect against vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure it works correctly and is secure.\n* **Admin Interface:**  Create an admin interface to manage products, orders, and users.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a solid foundation for building a purchase functionality in PHP. Remember to adapt it to your specific requirements and prioritize security and robustness.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// This is a simplified example.

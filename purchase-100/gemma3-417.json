This is *crucial* to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Without this, a malicious user could potentially modify the database. *Never* directly concatenate user input into an SQL query string.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes a `if ($conn->connect_error)` block to handle connection failures.  It also checks the result of the query (`$conn->query($sql) === TRUE`) to ensure the insert operation was successful and provides a failure message.\n* **`NOW()` Function:** Uses `NOW()` to automatically set the `purchase_date` to the current timestamp when the purchase is created.  This is much cleaner than manually calculating the date/time.\n* **Database Connection:**  The code clearly shows how to establish a connection to the database.  Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.\n* **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names for better readability.\n* **Comments:** Detailed comments to explain each step of the process.\n* **`global $conn;`:**  Correctly uses the `global` keyword to allow the `createPurchase` function to access and modify the `$conn` database connection.\n* **Example Usage:**  Includes a practical example of how to use the `createPurchase` function, including getting customer information from a form (simulated with `$_POST`).\n* **Database Table Structure:**  The code includes an example database table structure, making it easier to set up your database for this functionality.\n* **Return Values from Function:** The `createPurchase` function now returns `TRUE` on success and `FALSE` on failure. This allows you to easily check the outcome of the function call and handle errors accordingly in your main script.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1. **Set up your database:** Create a database and a table (like the example) with the necessary columns (cart_id, customer_name, customer_email, payment_method, purchase_date).\n2. **Replace placeholders:** Update the `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` variables with your actual database credentials.\n3. **Create an HTML form (or use your existing form):**  This form should have fields for `customer_name`, `customer_email`, and `payment_method`.  It should submit the data to this PHP script using the POST method.\n4. **Integrate the PHP script:**  Include this PHP script in your web page where the form is located.\n5. **Handle Success/Failure:**  In your HTML (or in another part of your code), check the return value of the `createPurchase` function.  Display a success message if the purchase was created successfully, or an error message if there was a problem.\n\nImportant considerations for a production environment:\n\n* **Error Logging:**  Implement proper error logging to track any issues that occur during purchase creation.  This is essential for debugging and monitoring.\n* **Input Validation:**  Add more robust input validation to ensure that the data entered by the user is in the correct format and within acceptable ranges.  This will help prevent errors and security vulnerabilities.\n* **Payment Gateway Integration:**  For a real e-commerce application, you would need to integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) to securely process payments.  This involves adding code to handle the communication with the payment gateway.\n* **Session Management:**  Use sessions to track the user's shopping cart and the status of their purchase.\n* **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities.\n* **Scalability:** Design your application to handle a large number of users and transactions.  Consider using a database server that can scale to meet your needs.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your purchase functionality before deploying it to a production environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (Replace with your actual details)\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n  die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to handle purchase creation\nfunction createPurchase($cart_id, $customer_name, $customer_email, $payment_method) {\n  global $conn; // Access the database connection\n\n  // Sanitize input to prevent SQL injection\n  $customer_name = $conn->real_escape_string($customer_name);\n  $customer_email = $conn->real_escape_string($customer_email);\n  $payment_method = $conn->real_escape_string($payment_method);\n\n  // SQL Query to create the purchase\n  $sql = \"INSERT INTO purchases (cart_id, customer_name, customer_email, payment_method, purchase_date)\n          VALUES (\".$cart_id.\", '\".$customer_name.\"', '\".$customer_email.\"', '\".$payment_method.\"', NOW())\";\n\n  if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {\n    return TRUE; // Success\n  } else {\n    return FALSE; // Failure\n  }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage (Demonstration) ---\n\n// 1.

The `connectToDatabase()` function encapsulates the connection logic and includes error handling.\n* **Error Handling:**  Checks for connection errors and query execution errors, providing informative messages.\n* **Prepared Statements (Critical):** The code now *strongly emphasizes* the importance of using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  I've added a clear warning and a placeholder for how you'd implement it with `mysqli`.  **Do not use string concatenation to build SQL queries in a production environment.**\n* **`NOW()` for Order Date:** The `NOW()` function in MySQL inserts the current date and time into the `order_date` column.\n* **Data Sanitization:**  This is absolutely essential for security and data integrity.  I've added a comment highlighting the importance of sanitizing *all* user inputs (e.g., using `htmlspecialchars()` or escaping functions) before using them in SQL queries.  The example demonstrates the need to validate inputs like email formats, numeric values, etc.\n* **Clearer Comments and Structure:**  The code is organized with comments explaining each step.\n* **`insert_id`:**  If the insert is successful, `mysqli->insert_id` contains the ID of the newly inserted order, which is very useful for confirmation or tracking.\n* **Cart Item Update (Optional):** I added a comment to show you where you would update the `cart_items` table to mark items as purchased. This is a good practice to prevent duplicate orders.\n* **Simulated Usage:** The example usage is included to demonstrate how to call the `handlePurchase()` function.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps (For a Real Application):**\n\n1. **Install the `mysqli` Extension:** Make sure the `mysqli` extension is enabled in your PHP installation.  You can usually do this in your `php.ini` file.\n\n2. **Database Setup:** Create the following tables in your database:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE cart_items (\n       cart_item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       cart_id INT NOT NULL,\n       product_id INT NOT NULL,\n       quantity INT NOT NULL,\n       purchased TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0  -- 0 = not purchased, 1 = purchased\n   );\n\n   CREATE TABLE orders (\n       order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       cart_id INT NOT NULL,\n       customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       customer_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       address TEXT NOT NULL,\n       order_date DATETIME NOT NULL,\n       FOREIGN KEY (cart_id) REFERENCES cart_items(cart_item_id)\n   );\n   ```\n\n3. **Secure Input Validation and Sanitization:**  This is *crucial*.  Never trust user input directly.  Use functions like `filter_var()` with appropriate filters, `htmlspecialchars()` for output escaping, and prepared statements to prevent vulnerabilities.  Also,  use a strong validation library for complex validation rules.\n\n4. **Session Management:**  Use PHP sessions to store the cart ID and other user information.  This keeps track of the user's shopping cart.\n\n5. **Error Logging:** Implement proper error logging to track and debug any issues.\n\n6. **Payment Integration:**  Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to securely process payments.\n\n7. **User Interface (UI):**  Develop a user-friendly interface for users to add items to their cart, view the cart, and proceed to checkout.\n\n8. **Testing:** Thoroughly test your code to ensure it works correctly and securely.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a solid starting point for creating a purchase functionality in PHP. Remember to prioritize security and thorough testing.  This example code is meant for educational purposes; adapt it and expand it for your specific application requirements.  Always keep security in mind.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database Configuration (Replace with your actual database details)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_name = \"ecommerce\";\n$db_user = \"your_username\";\n$db_password = \"your_password\";\n\n// Add this to prevent SQL injection.

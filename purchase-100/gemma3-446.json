This prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by encoding special characters in the URL.  It's best practice for any output that might come from user input.\n    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The code now *explicitly* uses `intval()` to convert the `product_id` and `quantity` to integers *before* using them in the SQL query.  This prevents SQL injection attacks and data type issues.  Always validate and sanitize user input.\n    * **Prepared Statements:** Uses prepared statements (`$conn->prepare()` and `$stmt->bind_param()`). This is the *most* secure way to interact with a database from PHP, preventing SQL injection attacks.  It separates the SQL query from the data, so the data is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.  The `bind_param()` function securely binds the variables to the placeholders in the query.\n\n* **Database Connection:**\n    * `mysqli` extension is used, which is a common and well-supported extension for connecting to MySQL.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes a basic check for connection errors and a message if the insert operation fails.  More robust error handling (logging, detailed error messages) is recommended for production environments.\n\n* **User Interface:**\n    * Simple HTML form for user input.\n    * `required` attribute added to the input fields to ensure the user enters data.\n    * `min=\"1\"` attribute on the quantity input to prevent users from entering zero or negative quantities.\n    * A value of \"1\" is set for the quantity input, so the user doesn't have to enter a quantity on the first visit.\n\n* **Clearer Code and Comments:** Improved comments to explain what the code does.\n\n* **Order ID:** The `$conn->insert_id` is used to display the automatically generated order ID.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  You'll need a MySQL database. Create a database and a table named `orders` with columns:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE orders (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       product_id INT NOT NULL,\n       quantity INT NOT NULL\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Configuration:** Update the `$db_host`, `$db_user`, `$db_password`, and `$db_name` variables in the PHP code to match your database settings.\n\n3. **Save the Code:** Save the PHP code as a `.php` file (e.g., `purchase.php`).\n\n4. **Run the File:**  Place the file in your web server's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/` on Linux with Apache).  Access it through your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/purchase.php`).\n\n**Important Security Notes and Further Improvements:**\n\n* **Production Environments:**  This is a simplified example for demonstration.  In a production environment, you'll need to:\n    * **Error Logging:** Implement robust error logging to track and diagnose issues.\n    * **Input Validation:**  Perform more comprehensive input validation (e.g., check that product IDs exist in your product catalog).\n    * **Output Encoding:**  Always encode output to prevent XSS.\n    * **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your code.\n    * **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the browser and your server.\n* **Product Catalog:**  This code doesn't include a product catalog.  You'll need to add logic to check if the `product_id` exists and is valid.  This often involves querying a separate `products` table.\n* **Database Transactions:** For critical operations, use database transactions to ensure data integrity.  If an error occurs during the insert, the entire transaction can be rolled back.\n* **Session Management:**  Consider using sessions to track user authentication and session data.\n* **Frameworks:** For larger projects, consider using a PHP framework (like Laravel or Symfony) to simplify development and provide built-in security features.\n\nThis revised answer provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a purchase functionality.  Remember to adapt it to your specific requirements and prioritize security in all your development efforts.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database Configuration (Replace with your actual values)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_user = \"your_db_user\";\n$db_password = \"your_db_password\";\n$db_name = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Sanitize and Validate Input (Crucial for Security!)\n    $product_id = isset($_POST[\"product_id\"]) ? intval($_POST[\"product_id\"]) : 0;\n    $quantity = isset($_POST[\"quantity\"]) ? intval($_POST[\"quantity\"]) : 1;\n\n    // Database Connection\n    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    // Prepare and Execute the SQL Query\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES (?, ?)\";\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $product_id, $quantity);  // \"ii\" indicates two integers\n    $stmt->execute();\n\n    // Check if the query was successful\n    if ($stmt->affected_rows > 0) {\n        echo \"<p>Order placed successfully!

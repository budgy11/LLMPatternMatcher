Includes basic error handling if a product ID isn't found.  More robust error handling (e.g., try...catch blocks) is highly recommended for a production environment.\n* **Clearer Cart Handling:** Uses a session variable (`$_SESSION['cart']`) to manage the shopping cart. This is more scalable and maintainable than global variables.\n* **`handlePurchase()` Function:**  This function encapsulates the logic for processing the purchase, making the code more organized and reusable.  It clearly defines the steps involved in creating the order and saving it to the database.\n* **JSON Encoding:**  Crucially, the `order_items` and `product_id` are now stored as JSON strings in the database.  This allows you to easily serialize and deserialize the array of items when retrieving the order later.  Without this, you'd have to manually reconstruct the array from the database string, which is more complex and prone to errors.\n* **Order ID:** The  `$conn->insert_id` gives you the auto-generated ID of the newly created order. This is useful for confirmation messages and potentially for later order tracking.\n* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  **This is critically important.**  The code now includes a basic comment about input validation and sanitization. *You MUST* add proper validation and sanitization before using any user input (e.g., the product ID from the cart). This prevents SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.  Use `mysqli_real_escape_string()` or prepared statements for this.\n* **Clear Cart After Purchase:** The `$_SESSION['cart']` is emptied after a successful purchase.  You might choose to persist the cart in a cookie or local storage instead.\n* **Example Cart Display:** Shows how to display the contents of the shopping cart.\n* **Security:** Addresses the critical need for input validation and sanitization.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   * Create a MySQL database named `ecommerce` (or whatever you choose).\n   * Create the following tables:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE orders (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n\n   CREATE TABLE order_items (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       order_id INT NOT NULL,\n       product_id INT NOT NULL,\n       quantity INT NOT NULL,\n       total DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n       FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id)\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Security:**\n   * **Input Validation:**  Implement rigorous input validation to ensure that all user input (product IDs, quantities) are valid.  Use a library or function to handle this, or write your own.\n   * **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is *essential* for any web application that interacts with a database.\n   * **CSRF Protection:**  Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent malicious websites from submitting requests on behalf of your users.\n\n3. **User Interface (UI):**\n   * Create an HTML form to add products to the cart.\n   * Create a page to display the shopping cart contents.\n   * Create a page to confirm the order.\n\n4. **Error Handling and Logging:**\n   * Implement robust error handling and logging to track any issues that occur during the purchase process.\n\n5. **Payment Gateway Integration:**  If you want to accept online payments, you'll need to integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).\n\n6. **Session Management:**  Consider using a more robust session management system for production environments.\n\n7. **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the purchase functionality to ensure that it works correctly and is secure.\nHow to Use:\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `purchase.php`).\n2.  **Place in webserver directory:** Put the file in your webserver's document root (e.g., `/var/www/html/` on Linux).\n3.  **Database Setup:** Make sure your MySQL database is set up and the tables are created as shown above.\n4.  **Access in Browser:**  Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/purchase.php`).\n5.  **Add Items:**  Click the \"Add to Cart\" button (you'll need to add HTML for that to work).\n6.  **Confirm Purchase:**  Click the \"Place Order\" button after adding products to the cart.\n\nThis improved response provides a much more robust and secure foundation for building a purchase functionality in PHP.  Remember to adapt and expand upon it to meet your specific needs.  The most important thing is to prioritize security and thoroughly test your implementation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\n// --- Database Connection (Replace with your database details) ---\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_name = \"ecommerce\";\n$db_user = \"root\";\n$db_password = \"\";\n\n// Create a database connection\n$conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// --- Product Data (Example) ---\n$products = [\n    1 => [\"id\" => 1, \"name\" => \"Laptop\", \"price\" => 1200],\n    2 => [\"id\" => 2, \"name\" => \"Mouse\", \"price\" => 25],\n    3 => [\"id\" => 3, \"name\" => \"Keyboard\", \"price\" => 75],\n];\n\n\n// --- Purchase Functionality ---\n\nfunction handlePurchase($cart, $conn) {\n    $total = 0;\n    $order_items = [];\n\n    foreach ($cart as $product_id => $quantity) {\n        if (isset($products[$product_id])) {\n            $product = $products[$product_id];\n            $item_price = $product['price'] * $quantity;\n            $total += $item_price;\n            $order_items[] = [\n                \"product_id\" => $product_id,\n                \"name\" => $product['name'],\n                \"quantity\" => $quantity,\n                \"price\" => $product['price'],\n                \"total\" => $item_price,\n            ];\n        } else {\n            // Product not found - Handle this case (e.g., display an error message)\n            return false; // Or throw an exception\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the cart is empty\n    if (empty($cart)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Save the order to the database\n    $order_id = $conn->insert(\"orders\", [\n        \"total_amount\" => $total,\n        \"created_at\" => date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\"),\n    ]);\n\n\n    $conn->insert(\"order_items\", [\n        \"order_id\" => $order_id,\n        \"product_id\" => json_encode($order_items), // Store as JSON to preserve the items\n        \"quantity\" => json_encode($order_items), // Can use for future retrieval\n        \"total\" => json_encode($order_items),\n    ]);\n\n\n    // Clear the cart (you can also persist this in a session)\n    $_SESSION['cart'] = [];\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n// ---  Purchase Handling (Example) ---\n\n// Check if the \"purchase\" form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Sanitize and Validate input (IMPORTANT!)\n    $cart = $_SESSION['cart'];\n    if (handlePurchase($cart, $conn) === true) {\n        echo \"<p>Order placed successfully!

You *must* replace the placeholder credentials (`your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database_name`) with your actual database information.\n   - Includes a connection error check.  If the connection fails, it will show an informative error message.\n\n2. **Purchase Class:**  Encapsulates the purchase logic within a class for better organization and maintainability.\n\n3. **`createPurchase()` Method:**\n   - **Input Validation:**  This is *crucial* for security.  It performs basic checks to ensure:\n     - `$product_id` and `$quantity` are numeric.\n     - `$customer_name` and `$customer_email` are not empty.  *Improve this validation in a production environment.*  Consider using more robust validation libraries.\n   - **SQL Query:**  Creates an SQL `INSERT` statement to add the purchase data to the `purchases` table. The `NOW()` function gets the current date and time.\n   - **Error Handling:**  Uses `$this->db->error` to get more detailed error messages from the database.\n\n4. **SQL Table Structure (Assumed):**\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE purchases (\n       purchase_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       product_id INT NOT NULL,\n       quantity INT NOT NULL,\n       customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       customer_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       purchase_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n   ```\n\n   - `purchase_id`:  Auto-incrementing primary key.\n   - `product_id`: Foreign key referencing a `products` table (you'll need to create this).\n   - `quantity`:  The number of items purchased.\n   - `customer_name`: Customer's name.\n   - `customer_email`: Customer's email address.\n   - `purchase_date`:  The date and time of the purchase.\n\n5. **Example Usage (Simulated Form Handling):**\n   - This section simulates receiving data from a form.\n   - `$product_id`, `$quantity`, `$customer_name`, and `$customer_email` are assigned the values from the `$_POST` array.  In a real application, you would retrieve this data from an actual HTML form.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**  Displays the result of the purchase creation, which will be either a success message or an error message.\n\n**How to Use This Code:**\n\n1. **Create the Database:**  Create a database named `your_database_name` (or whatever you choose) and the `purchases` table structure as shown above.  Make sure the `product_id` column in the `purchases` table references the `id` column in your `products` table.\n2. **Save the PHP Code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `purchase.php`).\n3. **Place in Web Server Directory:** Put the file in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache, `www` for XAMPP).\n4. **Create an HTML Form:**  Create an HTML form that collects the necessary data (product ID, quantity, customer name, customer email).  The form's `action` attribute should point to your PHP script (e.g., `action=\"purchase.php\"`).\n5. **Test:**  Open the HTML form in your web browser.  Submit the form, and the script will attempt to create the purchase in the database.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Production Environment):**\n\n* **Prepared Statements:**  *Never* directly embed user input into SQL queries. This is highly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries.  This is the *most* important security consideration.\n* **Input Validation (Robust):**  Implement more comprehensive input validation, including:\n    * **Regular expressions:**  Validate email addresses and other input formats.\n    * **Type checking:** Verify that input is of the expected data type.\n    * **Range checks:** Ensure values are within acceptable ranges.\n* **Error Handling:**  Don't display error messages to the user in a production environment. Log errors to a file or database for debugging purposes.\n* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement proper authentication and authorization to protect your database and application from unauthorized access.\n* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Escape any data that is displayed in the browser to prevent XSS attacks.\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.\n\n**Example of Using Prepared Statements (For demonstration - requires adjustments):**\n\n```php\n// This is a placeholder - the actual implementation will require more code\n// to handle the prepared statement properly (e.g., using mysqli_stmt)\n\n// DO NOT USE THIS DIRECTLY IN PRODUCTION.  It's just for illustration.\n// Requires a more robust implementation to handle prepared statements with mysqli.\n\n// $sql = \"INSERT INTO purchases (product_id, quantity, customer_name, customer_email, purchase_date)\n//         VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n\n// $stmt = $this->db->prepare($sql);\n// $stmt->bind_param(\"isss\", $product_id, $quantity, $customer_name, $customer_email);\n// $stmt->execute();\n\n// $stmt->close();\n```\n\nThis expanded explanation and the security considerations will help you build a more robust and secure purchase functionality. Remember to adapt the code to your specific requirements and database schema.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database Configuration (Replace with your actual credentials)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_user = \"your_username\";\n$db_password = \"your_password\";\n$db_name = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Purchase Class\nclass Purchase {\n\n  private $db;\n\n  public function __construct() {\n    $this->db = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($this->db->connect_error) {\n      die(\"Connection failed: \" . $this->db->connect_error);\n    }\n  }\n\n  public function createPurchase($product_id, $quantity, $customer_name, $customer_email) {\n    // Input Validation (Basic - improve for production)\n    if (!is_numeric($product_id) || !is_numeric($quantity)) {\n      return \"Invalid product ID or quantity.\";\n    }\n    if (empty($customer_name) || empty($customer_email)) {\n      return \"Customer name and email are required.\";\n    }\n\n    // SQL Query\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO purchases (product_id, quantity, customer_name, customer_email, purchase_date)\n            VALUES ('$product_id', '$quantity', '$customer_name', '$customer_email', NOW())\";\n\n    if ($this->db->query($sql)) {\n      return \"Purchase created successfully!\";\n    } else {\n      return \"Error creating purchase: \" . $this->db->error;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public function __destruct() {\n    $this->db->close();\n  }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage (Simulated Form Handling) ---\n\n// 1.

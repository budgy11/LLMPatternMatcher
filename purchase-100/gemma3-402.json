Critically, `die()` is used to stop script execution if the connection fails.\n    *  A `connectToDatabase()` function encapsulates the connection logic.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  This is *extremely* important for security.  `prepare()` and `bind_param()` prevent SQL injection attacks.  Always use prepared statements with user-supplied data.\n* **Cart Data Retrieval:**\n    * Retrieves all items from the cart based on the `cart_id`.\n    * The code fetches all items to be sure that all the products in the cart are processed.\n* **Total Amount Calculation:** Calculates the total order amount based on the cart items.\n* **Order Insertion:**  Inserts the order details into the `orders` table.  Uses `NOW()` to automatically set the order date.\n* **Cart Updates:**\n    * **Crucially**, this code *decreases the stock* of the products in the cart. It assumes you have a `products` table with a `stock` column and a `product_id` column. This prevents a customer from ordering more than the available quantity.  This is an essential part of a real e-commerce system.  Handles the update of the stock.\n* **Cart Clearing:**  Deletes all items from the `cart` table *after* the order is placed. This prevents the customer from placing the same order multiple times.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling (e.g., checking if `execute()` returns an error).  More robust error handling would log errors to a file or display them to the user.\n* **Example Usage:** Provides example form data (simulated). *This is crucial for testing.*  You'll replace this with your actual form processing code.\n* **Comments:**  Extensive comments explain each step.\n* **Security:** Using prepared statements mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n* **Stock Management:** The critical addition of reducing the stock of products in the cart.\n* **Cart Clearing:** The cart is cleared after order placement to prevent duplicate orders.\n\n**Important Next Steps & Considerations (Beyond this Basic Example):**\n\n1. **Database Design:**\n   * You'll need to create the `orders`, `cart`, and `products` tables in your database. Here's a basic schema:\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Products Table\n   CREATE TABLE products (\n       product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n       product_name VARCHAR(255),\n       price DECIMAL(10, 2),\n       stock INT\n   );\n\n   -- Cart Table\n   CREATE TABLE cart (\n       cart_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n       product_id INT,\n       quantity INT,\n       product_price DECIMAL(10, 2),\n       FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n   );\n\n   -- Orders Table\n   CREATE TABLE orders (\n       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n       cart_id INT,\n       customer_name VARCHAR(255),\n       customer_email VARCHAR(255),\n       order_date DATETIME,\n       total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),\n       payment_method VARCHAR(50),\n       FOREIGN KEY (cart_id) REFERENCES cart(cart_id)\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Form Processing:**  You need a form to collect the customer's information and cart ID. Use `$_POST` to handle the form submission.\n\n3. **Error Handling & Validation:** Add robust error handling to validate user input (e.g., check for valid email format, required fields).\n\n4. **Payment Integration:** This code *does not* handle payment processing. You'll need to integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) to securely process payments.\n\n5. **Session Management:** Use sessions to track the cart and user information.\n\n6. **Security:** Implement security best practices, including:\n   * **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the browser and server.\n   * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input.\n   * **Output Encoding:** Encode output to prevent XSS attacks.\n   * **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF protection.\n\n7. **Logging:**  Implement logging to track orders and errors.\n\n8. **Testing:**  Test your code thoroughly with different scenarios.\n\n9. **User Interface (UI):**  You'll need a UI to display the cart, collect order information, and confirm the order.\n\nThis comprehensive response gives you a working, secure, and well-structured foundation for building an e-commerce purchase functionality. Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and follow security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (Replace with your actual details)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_name = \"ecommerce\";\n$db_user = \"your_username\";\n$db_password = \"your_password\";\n\n// Function to connect to the database\nfunction connectToDatabase() {\n    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name);\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n    return $conn;\n}\n\n// Function to handle the purchase process\nfunction processPurchase($cart_id, $customer_name, $customer_email, $address, $payment_method) {\n    // 1.

I'll provide the core login.php script, along with explanations and considerations. **This is a simplified example and isn't production-ready.**  A real e-commerce site would require extensive security measures, error handling, input validation, session management, and more.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Database:** You'll use a MySQL database with tables for users (users, passwords)\n*   **Form:**  You have an HTML form (login.html) that collects username and password.\n*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included.\n*   **Security:** *This code is for demonstration purposes only.* You MUST implement robust security measures (hashing passwords, input validation, protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.) in any real-world application.\n\n**Directory Structure (Example):**\n\n```\necommerce/\n    - index.php\n    - products.php\n    - cart.php\n    - login.php\n    - register.php\n    - login.html  (HTML form)\n    - register.html (HTML form)\n    - database.php  (Database connection details)\n```\n\n**1. `database.php` (Database Connection)**\n\n```php\n\u003c?php\n\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$database = \"ecommerce_db\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\nif ($conn-\u003econnect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn-\u003econnect_error);\n}\n\n//You can add database query functions here (e.g., fetch_user_by_username)\n//For now, just a placeholder\n//Example:\n//$result = $conn-\u003equery(\"SELECT * FROM users\");\n//if ($result-\u003enum_rows \u003e 0) {\n//  //Process results (not shown here)\n//}\n\n?\u003e\n```\n\n**2. `login.php` (Login Logic)**\n\n```php\n\u003c?php\n\n// Include database connection file\nrequire_once 'database.php';\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n\n    // Sanitize input (VERY IMPORTANT - use proper escaping for your database system!)\n    $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST[\"username\"]);\n    $password = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST[\"password\"]);\n\n    // Simple password validation (NEVER store passwords in plain text!)\n    // Ideally, hash passwords on registration and compare against a hashed password\n    // For demonstration purposes, we'll check against a \"hashed\" password\n    // (In a real system, use bcrypt, Argon2, or a similar algorithm)\n\n    $query = \"SELECT id, username, hashed_password FROM users WHERE username = '$username'\";\n    $result = $conn-\u003equery($query);\n\n    if ($result-\u003enum_rows == 1) {\n        $row = $result-\u003efetch_assoc();\n        $hashed_password = $row['hashed_password'];\n\n        // Verify password (In a real application, compare hashed passwords)\n        if (password_verify($password, $hashed_password)) {\n            // Login successful!\n            session_start();  //Start session\n\n            // Store user data in session\n            $_SESSION[\"user_id\"] = $row[\"id\"];\n            $_SESSION[\"username\"] = $row[\"username\"];\n\n            // Redirect to a secure page (e.g., user dashboard)\n            header(\"Location: user_dashboard.php\"); //Create user_dashboard.php\n            exit(); //Stop further script execution\n        } else {\n            // Incorrect password\n            $error = \"Incorrect password.\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        // User not found\n        $error = \"User not found.\";\n    }\n}\n\n?\u003e\n\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eLogin\u003c/title\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eLogin\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003c?php\nif (isset($error)) {\n    echo \"\u003cp style='color:red;'\u003e$error\u003c/p\u003e\";\n}\n?\u003e\n\n\u003cform method=\"post\" action=\"login.php\"\u003e\n    Username: \u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"username\" /\u003e\n    Password: \u003cinput type=\"password\" name=\"password\" /\u003e\n    \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\" /\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"register.php\"\u003eNot registered?

Consider using prepared statements (parameterized queries) for even better security.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection:**  Escape output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n*   **Session Security:**  Implement secure session management practices, including setting appropriate session cookies attributes and using HTTPS.\n*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n*   **CSRF Protection:** Use CSRF tokens to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.\n*   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the user's browser and your server.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides you with the `login.php` script, along with the `database.php` file, and key security considerations. Remember to adapt and expand upon this foundation to create a secure and functional e-commerce site.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This code is for educational purposes only.  It is not production-ready and may contain vulnerabilities.  Always prioritize security best practices when developing your e-commerce application.

Okay, let's build a basic e-commerce site skeleton with a comprehensive `forgot-password.php` implementation, including MySQL database interaction for password resets.

**Important Disclaimer:**  This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. **DO NOT USE THIS CODE DIRECTLY IN PRODUCTION.**  It lacks crucial security measures like:

*   Input validation
*   Rate limiting (to prevent brute-force attacks)
*   Secure session management
*   Proper error handling
*   Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) -  All data should be transmitted over HTTPS.
*   SQL Injection protection (use parameterized queries - I'll show the correct approach).
*   More robust password hashing.


**1. E-commerce Site Structure (Simplified)**

We'll create a basic file structure to keep things organized. You'll likely have a more complex structure in a real application.

```
ecommerce/
├── index.php          (Homepage)
├── products.php       (Product Listing)
├── product.php       (Product Details)
├── cart.php           (Shopping Cart)
├── checkout.php       (Checkout Process)
├── admin/
│   ├── admin.php    (Admin Dashboard)
│   ├── products.php (Admin Product Management)
│   └── users.php     (Admin User Management - For testing, we'll include user creation here)
├── forgot-password.php (Forgot Password Form & Logic)
├── style.css         (CSS Styles)
└── database.php      (MySQL Connection File)
```

**2. database.php (MySQL Connection)**

This file establishes the connection to your MySQL database.

```php
<?php

$host = "localhost";
$username = "your_db_username";
$password = "your_db_password";
$database = "ecommerce_db";

$conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// If you need to perform database operations here, do it from this file.

?>
```

**3. forgot-password.php**

This is the core of the password reset functionality.

```php
<?php

// Include the database connection file
require_once 'database.php';

// Check if the form has been submitted
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $email = trim($_POST['email']);

    // Validate email (basic validation - improve in a real app)
    if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
        $error = "Invalid email address.";
    } else {
        // Prepare the SQL query (using prepared statements - crucial for security)
        $query = "SELECT id, password FROM users WHERE email = ?";
        $stmt = $conn->prepare($query);

        if ($stmt) {
            $stmt->bind_param("s", $email); // "s" indicates a string parameter
            $stmt->execute();
            $result = $stmt->get_result();

            if ($result->num_rows == 1) {
                $user = $result->fetch_assoc();
                $userId = $user['id'];
                $hashedPassword = $user['password']; // Assume password is already hashed

                // Set a temporary password (stronger passwords should be generated)
                $tempPassword = 'temp_password_123';

                // Update the user's password (temporarily)
                $query = "UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE id = ?";
                $stmt = $conn->prepare($query);

                if ($stmt) {
                    $stmt->bind_param("ss", $tempPassword, $userId);
                    $stmt->execute();

                    if ($stmt->affected_rows > 0) {
                        // Send an email with the temporary password
                        // (Implement email sending logic here - e.g., using PHPMailer)
                        // For example:
                        // $to = $email;
                        // $subject = 'Temporary Password for E-commerce';
                        // $message = 'Your temporary password is: ' . $tempPassword .
                        //             '<br><br>Please update your password immediately.';
                        // $headers = "From: ecommerce@example.com";
                        // mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);

                        $success = "Password reset email sent.  Check your email.";
                    } else {
                        $error = "Error resetting password.";
                    }
                } else {
                    $error = "Error preparing statement.";
                }
            } else {
                $error = "No user found with this email address.";
            }
        } else {
            $error = "Error preparing statement.";
        }
    }
}
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Forgot Password</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Forgot Password</h1>

<?php if (isset($error)) { ?>
    <p style="color: red;"><?php echo $error; ?></p>
<?php } ?>

<?php if (isset($success)) { ?>
    <p style="color: green;"><?php echo $success; ?></p>
<?php } ?>

<form method="post" action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]); ?>">
    <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email">
    <button type="submit">Reset Password</button>
</form>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1.  **Prepared Statements:** The `prepare()` and `bind_param()` functions are used to construct the SQL query. This is *essential* for preventing SQL injection attacks.  Instead of directly inserting user input into the query string, you prepare the query and then bind the parameters.  The database driver handles escaping and quoting the values, preventing malicious code from being executed.

2.  **Input Validation:** `filter_var()` is used to validate the email address.  This is a basic validation; you should add more robust validation in a real application (e.g., check for valid characters, length limits).

3.  **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling and displays error messages to the user.

4.  **Temporary Password:** Sets a temporary password for the user to use until they can change it.  *Do not use hardcoded passwords in a real application.*  Use a proper password generation function.

5.  **Clearer Structure:** The code is structured with `if` statements to handle form submission, error handling, and success messages.

6. **htmlspecialchars():**  Used to escape HTML entities of the `$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]` variable, preventing XSS vulnerabilities.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Database Setup:** Create a MySQL database and a `users` table with at least `id`, `email`, and `password` columns.  Remember that the `password` column should store *hashed* passwords, not plain text.  Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have a PHP environment set up and that the `mysqli` extension is enabled.

3.  **Configuration:** Update the database connection details (`$host`, `$username`, `$password`, `$database`) in `database.php` with your actual values.

4.  **Testing:**  Test the `forgot-password.php` page.  Go to the page and enter a valid email address that exists in your database.  You should receive a password reset email (if you have email sending implemented) or a success message.  Try entering an invalid email address to see the error handling.

**Important Security Considerations (Beyond this example):**

*   **Secure Session Management:**  Use secure PHP session management techniques.
*   **Password Hashing:** Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Email Sending:** Use a reliable email service and implement proper email sending security practices.
*   **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your application.
*   **Keep PHP and Libraries Updated:**  Always use the latest versions of PHP and any libraries you are using.

This comprehensive response provides a starting point for a basic password reset functionality.  Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices when building any e-commerce application. Remember to always test thoroughly.  This example is for educational purposes only.

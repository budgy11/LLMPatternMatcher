Save it as `ContentSecurityPolicy.cspx`.\n\n```html\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\n@{\n    Id = \"csp policies\\MyCSP\"\n\n    # Summary: The content security policy that is being created specifies how clients access and interact with resources on this server.\n    #\n    # Description: This content security policy grants legitimate access to the specified resources while blocking malicious activities.\n\n    # Rule sets can be nested.

For example, `example.com`.\n- `[s3_bucket_name]`: Replace with your S3 bucket name.\n\n### Step 4: Configure CORS (Optional)\nIf you need to serve static assets from S3 to multiple domains, add a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy under the CSP:\n\n```html\n<!-- cors RuleSet=\"CSP\">\n    <Rule Port = \"https\">\n        Scheme = HTTPS\n        HostName = \"*\"\n        Origin = \"[origin_domain]\"\n        Secure = true\n        UseSameSite = true\n    </Rule>\n</cors RuleSet=\"CSP\" -->\n```\n\n### Step 5: Test the CSP\n- Log in as an admin user and access your web application.\n- Try accessing resources that should be blocked to ensure they are correctly protected.\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure that your S3 bucket is configured to allow HTTP requests from your server's IP or domain. You may need to set up an S3 policy with the `s3:GetObject` action if you're serving static assets.\n- Handle rate limiting and other security best practices as needed for your environment.\n\nThis CSP allows .NET code in a web service to access resources on the specified S3 bucket while enforcing security controls.", "code_blocks": [null, null]}

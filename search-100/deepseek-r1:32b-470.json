{"prompt": "Create a search bar using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to create a search bar using PHP. Let me break down what that entails.\n\nFirst, I know that a search bar typically involves an HTML form where users can input their query and submit it. So, I'll start by setting up the basic HTML structure with a form element.\n\nNext, I need to handle the form submission. Since PHP is server-side, I'll use a POST method so that when the user submits the form, the data goes back to the same page or another script for processing. In this case, I'll have the form submit to itself, which means I'll check if the form has been submitted using $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'].\n\nNow, when the form is submitted, I need to capture the search term. I'll retrieve it from $_POST['search_term']. But before processing, I should sanitize this input to prevent SQL injection or other security issues. Using htmlspecialchars and trimming whitespace makes sense here.\n\nFor the database connection, I'll use MySQLi because it's more secure and supports object-oriented programming. I'll set up a try-catch block to handle any connection errors gracefully. If there's an error, the user will see a message explaining that the search couldn't be performed.\n\nAssuming the database is connected, I need to query the data based on the search term. Using prepared statements with placeholders helps prevent SQL injection. I'll prepare the statement and bind the parameter safely.\n\nAfter executing the query, I'll fetch the results. If there are results, I'll display them in a list. Each result should be linked so users can view more details. If no results are found, a friendly message will inform the user that nothing was found.\n\nI also want to include a feature where if the user hasn't searched yet, a set of default products is displayed. This makes the page useful even before any search query. I'll use an array of sample products and loop through them to display each one.\n\nStyling is important for usability, so I'll add some basic CSS to make the search bar and results look clean and responsive. Using flexbox ensures that elements adjust well on different screen sizes.\n\nFinally, I'll test the code by filling in the database connection details and ensuring that all parts work together. This includes checking form submission, handling errors, displaying results correctly, and showing default products when there's no search term.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a search bar using PHP:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Search Bar</title>\n    <!-- Add some basic styling -->\n    <style>\n        .search-container {\n            max-width: 600px;\n            margin: 50px auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n            background-color: #f9f9f9;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n        }\n\n        .search-bar {\n            width: 100%;\n            padding: 10px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            border-radius: 4px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n        }\n\n        .search-results {\n            list-style-type: none;\n            padding: 0;\n        }\n\n        .search-results li {\n            padding: 10px;\n            background-color: white;\n            margin-bottom: 5px;\n            border-radius: 4px;\n            box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n        }\n\n        .search-results li a {\n            color: #333;\n            text-decoration: none;\n        }\n\n        .search-results li a:hover {\n            color: #007bff;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"search-container\">\n        <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"POST\">\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"search_term\" class=\"search-bar\" placeholder=\"Search here...\">\n            <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n        </form>\n\n        <?php\n        // Database connection details\n        $servername = \"localhost\";\n        $username = \"your_username\";\n        $password = \"your_password\";\n        $dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n        try {\n            // Create connection\n            $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n            // Check connection\n            if ($conn->connect_error) {\n                die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n            }\n\n            // If form is submitted\n            if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n                $search_term = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['search_term']));\n                \n                if (!empty($search_term)) {\n                    // Prepare SQL query\n                    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column_name LIKE ?\");\n                    $search = \"%\" . $search_term . \"%\";\n                    \n                    // Bind parameters\n                    $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $search);\n                    \n                    // Execute the query\n                    $stmt->execute();\n                    \n                    // Get result\n                    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n                    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n                        echo \"<ul class='search-results'>\";\n                        while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n                            echo \"<li><a href='product.php?id=\" . $row['id'] . \"'>\" . $row['column_name'] . \"</a></li>\";\n                        }\n                        echo \"</ul>\";\n                    } else {\n                        echo \"<p>No results found.</p>\";\n                    }\n\n                    // Close statement\n                    $stmt->close();\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Show some default products if no search is performed\n                $default_products = array(\n                    \"Product 1\",\n                    \"Product 2\",\n                    \"Product 3\",\n                    \"Product 4\"\n                );\n\n                echo \"<ul class='search-results'>\";\n                foreach ($default_products as $product) {\n                    echo \"<li><a href='product.php'>\" . $product . \"</a></li>\";\n                }\n                echo \"</ul>\";\n            }\n\n            // Close connection\n            $conn->close();\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            die(\"Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        }\n        ?>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code creates a search bar with the following features:\n\n1.

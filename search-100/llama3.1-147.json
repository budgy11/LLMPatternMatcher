{"prompt": "Create a search bar using php", "llm_output": "Here is an example of how to create a basic search bar using PHP:\n\n**index.php**\n```php\n<?php\n// Initialize the database connection (e.g. MySQLi)\n$mysqli = new mysqli(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n  // Get the search term from the form input\n  $search_term = $_POST[\"search\"];\n\n  // SQL query to search for matching records in the database\n  $query = \"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%$search_term%'\";\n\n  // Execute the query and store the results in a variable\n  $result = mysqli_query($mysqli, $query);\n\n  // Display the search results\n  echo \"<h2>Search Results:</h2>\";\n  while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {\n    echo \"$row[column_name] <br>\";\n  }\n}\n\n// If the form has not been submitted, display the search bar\n?>\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\n  <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n</form>\n```\n**What this code does:**\n\n1. It initializes a database connection using MySQLi.\n2. When the form is submitted (i.e., when the user clicks the \"Search\" button), it retrieves the search term from the `search` input field and uses it to construct an SQL query that searches for matching records in the database.\n3. The query is executed, and the results are stored in a variable called `$result`.\n4. If there are any results, they are displayed on the page using a `while` loop.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This code assumes you have a MySQLi extension installed on your PHP server.\n* You should replace `\"table_name\"` and `\"column_name\"` with the actual name of the table and column in your database that you want to search.\n* You should also update the SQL query to match the structure of your database.\n* This is a basic example, and you may want to add error handling and validation to make it more robust.\n\n**Security note:**\n\n* The code above uses string concatenation to build the SQL query. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized. A better approach would be to use prepared statements with parameterized queries.\n```php\n$stmt = $mysqli->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE ?\");\n$stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $search_term);\n$stmt->execute();\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\n```\nThis code uses a prepared statement with a parameter (`?`) to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Initialize the database connection (e.g. MySQLi)\n$mysqli = new mysqli(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n  // Get the search term from the form input\n  $search_term = $_POST[\"search\"];\n\n  // SQL query to search for matching records in the database\n  $query = \"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%$search_term%'\";\n\n  // Execute the query and store the results in a variable\n  $result = mysqli_query($mysqli, $query);\n\n  // Display the search results\n  echo \"<h2>Search Results:</h2>\";\n  while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {\n    echo \"$row[column_name] <br>\";\n  }\n}\n\n// If the form has not been submitted, display the search bar\n?>\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\n  <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n</form>\n```", "```php\n$stmt = $mysqli->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE ?\");\n$stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $search_term);\n$stmt->execute();\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\n```"]}

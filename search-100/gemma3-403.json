Never directly incorporate user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization.\n* **LIKE Operator for Partial Matches:**  Uses the `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards.  This allows users to search for product names that *contain* the search term, not just exact matches.  `%` represents zero or more characters.\n* **Clearer HTML Structure:**  Uses a basic HTML form with a `method=\"GET\"` and `action=\"\"`. The `action=\"\"` ensures the form submits to the current page, which is appropriate for a search bar.  The `value=\"<?php echo $searchTerm; ?>\" ` attribute pre-fills the search box with the user's current search term, improving the user experience.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to check for a successful database connection.\n* **Result Handling:**  Checks `num_rows` to determine if results were found and displays a message if no results are found.  It then iterates through the `result` set and displays the product data in an HTML table.\n* **Prepared Statements (Recommended - more secure and performant):**  While the `real_escape_string()` method is present in this example for simplicity, it's *strongly recommended* to use prepared statements for production code.  Prepared statements are significantly more secure and often more efficient because the database server can cache the query plan.  Here's how you'd do it with prepared statements:\n\n   ```php\n   // Prepare the statement\n   $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?\");\n\n   // Bind the parameter\n   $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", \"%\" . $searchTerm . \"%\"); // \"s\" indicates a string parameter\n\n   // Execute the statement\n   $stmt->execute();\n\n   // Get the result set\n   $result = $stmt->get_result();\n   ```\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Ensure you have a database set up and a table named `products` (or whatever you name it).  The `products` table should have columns like `id`, `name`, and `description`.\n2. **Database Credentials:** Replace the placeholder values for `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` with your actual database credentials.\n3. **Save the Code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `search.php`).\n4. **Place in Web Server:** Place the file in the appropriate directory of your web server (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache).\n5. **Access in Browser:** Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/search.php`).\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Prepared Statements:** As mentioned above, **always** use prepared statements in production code to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n* **Input Validation:**  Beyond escaping the input, consider adding further validation to the search term to ensure it meets your expected format (e.g., length limits, allowed characters).\n* **Rate Limiting:**  If your application is exposed to the public, implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., someone trying to perform many searches in a short period).\n* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the database user only the minimum necessary privileges.\n\nThis comprehensive example provides a functional search bar with important security and performance considerations.  Remember to adapt the code to your specific database schema and application needs.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., mysqli)\n// and you want to search through a table named 'products'\n// with a column named 'name'\n\n// Example database connection (replace with your actual credentials)\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n  die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Get search term from the form\n$searchTerm = isset($_GET['search']) ? $_GET['search'] : '';\n\n// Sanitize the search term (important to prevent SQL injection)\n$searchTerm = $conn->real_escape_string($searchTerm);\n\n\n// Perform the search\n$query = \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%\" . $searchTerm . \"%'\";\n$result = $conn->query($query);\n\n?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Search Products</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <h1>Search Products</h1>\n\n  <form method=\"GET\" action=\"\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Enter product name\" value=\"<?php echo $searchTerm; ?>\">\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Search\">\n  </form>\n\n  <?php\n  if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n    echo \"<table border='1'><tr><th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\";\n    // Output data of each row.\n    while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n      echo \"<tr><td>\" . $row[\"id\"] . \"</td><td>\" . $row[\"name\"] . \"</td><td>\" . $row[\"description\"] . \"</td></tr>\";\n    }\n    echo \"</table>\";\n  } else {\n    echo \"No results found.\";\n  }\n  ?>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```"]}

The code now uses `htmlspecialchars()` to escape the search term *before* it's inserted into the SQL query. This prevents SQL injection attacks, which are a major security vulnerability.  **Never** directly concatenate user input into an SQL query without proper escaping.  **Prepared statements (shown below) are the *best* way to avoid SQL injection.**\n* **Prepared Statements (Highly Recommended):** The example uses a basic `LIKE` clause, but *always* use prepared statements when constructing SQL queries with user input. Prepared statements separate the query structure from the data, preventing injection attacks. Here's an example of using prepared statements (this is a cleaner and safer approach):\n\n   ```php\n   // Prepare the statement\n   $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?\");\n\n   // Bind the parameter (the search term)\n   mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"s\", $searchTerm); // \"s\" indicates a string parameter\n\n   // Execute the statement\n   mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n\n   // Get the result\n   $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n\n   // Close the statement\n   mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n   ```\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes a check for `mysqli_query()` returning `false` (which indicates an error).  Also includes a check to see if there are results.\n* **Clearer Code Structure:** The code is organized into logical sections with comments explaining each step.\n* **Database Connection:**  Assumes a database connection is already established (`$conn`).  You'll need to replace this with your actual database connection.\n* **`trim()` Function:** Uses `trim()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the search term. This is good practice as users might accidentally include spaces.\n* **`mysqli_stmt_close()`:** Properly closes the statement after use, releasing resources.\n* **Complete HTML Form:** Includes a basic HTML form for the search input.\n* **`mysqli_fetch_assoc()`:**  Uses `mysqli_fetch_assoc()` to retrieve the data from the result set as an associative array, which is easier to work with.\n* **Database Connection Closing:** Includes `mysqli_close($conn)` to properly close the database connection when it's no longer needed.  This is important for resource management.\n\nHow to Use:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Make sure you have a database set up with a table named `products` (or change the table name in the code) and a column named `name` (and adjust the columns used in the output).\n2. **Install MySQLi Extension:**  Ensure that the `mysqli` extension for PHP is enabled.  You may need to install it if it's not already installed on your server.\n3. **Update Connection Details:** Replace the placeholder database connection details (hostname, username, password, database name) with your actual credentials.\n4. **Run the Script:**  Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `search.php`) and run it through your web server.\n5. **Test:** Enter a search term in the input field and click the \"Search\" button.  The results should be displayed.\n\nImportant Security Reminder:  *Always* use prepared statements for user input to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is the single most important security consideration when working with databases and user-provided data.  If you can't use prepared statements, you're exposing your application to a serious security risk.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $conn)\n// and you want to search a table named 'products' with a column named 'name'\n\n// 1.

{"prompt": "Create a search bar using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants to create a search bar using PHP. I need to provide a clear and functional example. Let me break down what's needed.\n\nFirst, the basics: a search bar is an HTML form with an input field and a submit button. So I'll start by setting up the HTML structure. I'll include the doctype, head, and body tags. In the head, I should add some CSS styling to make it look nice, even if it's just basic styling.\n\nNext, the form itself. It needs an action attribute pointing to a PHP script that will handle the search. The method should be POST so that the query is sent securely. Inside the form, there's an input field of type text with a name like 'search_query' and a placeholder for guidance. Then, a submit button labeled \"Search.\"\n\nNow, onto the PHP part. The processing script needs to check if the form has been submitted. I'll use isset($_POST['search_query']) to determine that. If it's set, I'll retrieve the search term, sanitize it using htmlspecialchars to prevent XSS attacks, and then trim any extra spaces.\n\nAfter getting the clean query, the next step is to perform a database search. Since I don't have actual database credentials here, I'll mock this part by generating sample data. This way, the example remains simple but demonstrates how it would work in a real scenario.\n\nI'll loop through the sample results and display each one. To prevent SQL injection in a real setup, prepared statements should be used, but that's beyond the current scope. For now, I'll focus on processing and displaying the data correctly.\n\nFinally, if no search has been performed yet, I'll show a message prompting the user to enter their search term.\n\nI should also include some error handling, like checking for empty queries. If the user submits an empty form, it should either show an error or handle it gracefully.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the HTML with embedded PHP and add CSS styling within the style tags for simplicity. This makes the example self-contained without external files.\n\nI need to make sure the code is well-commented so that each part's purpose is clear. Also, since this is an example, I'll note where database connections or actual queries would be added in a real application.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are setting up the HTML form, processing it with PHP, sanitizing input, handling the search logic (even mock data for demonstration), and displaying results. The code should be clean, easy to understand, and include best practices like input sanitization.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of creating a simple search bar using PHP:\n\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Search Bar</title>\n    <style>\n        .search-container {\n            max-width: 500px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        .search-bar {\n            width: 100%;\n            padding: 10px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            border-radius: 4px;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"search-container\">\n        <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"POST\">\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"search_query\" class=\"search-bar\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Search\" style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 16px;\">\n        </form>\n    </div>\n\n    <?php\n    // Check if the form has been submitted\n    if (isset($_POST['search_query'])) {\n        $search_query = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['search_query']));\n        \n        // Here you would typically connect to your database and perform a search query\n        // For this example, we'll just display the search results mock-up\n        \n        // Mock search results\n        $results = array(\n            \"Result 1 related to: $search_query\",\n            \"Result 2 related to: $search_query\",\n            \"Result 3 related to: $search_query\"\n        );\n        \n        echo \"<h3>Search Results for '$search_query'</h3>\";\n        foreach ($results as $result) {\n            echo \"<p>$result</p>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Show this message when no search has been performed yet\n        echo \"<h3>Welcome! Enter your search above and press enter.</h3>\";\n    }\n    ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code creates a simple search bar with the following features:\n\n1. A clean, responsive design\n2. Basic styling for the search input and button\n3. Form submission handling using PHP\n4. Input validation and sanitization\n5. Display of mock search results\n\nTo use this in a real application, you would need to:\n\n1. Connect to your database (using PDO or mysqli)\n2. Replace the mock results with actual query results from your database\n3. Add proper error handling\n4. Implement pagination if you have many search results\n\nHere's how you might modify it to connect to a MySQL database:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection details\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'your_username';\n$password = 'your_password';\n$database = 'your_database';\n\ntry {\n    $conn = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$database\", $username, $password);\n    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n} catch(PDOException $e) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $e->getMessage());\n}\n\nif (isset($_POST['search_query'])) {\n    $search_query = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['search_query']));\n    \n    // Prepare SQL statement with a wildcard search\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE column_name LIKE ?\");\n    $search_term = '%' . $search_query . '%';\n    $stmt->execute([$search_term]);\n    \n    $results = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n    \n    if (count($results) > 0) {\n        echo \"<h3>Search Results for '$search_query'</h3>\";\n        foreach ($results as $result) {\n            // Display your results appropriately\n            echo \"<p>\" . $result['column_name'] . \"</p>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"<p>No results found for '$search_query'.</p>\";\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nRemember to replace the database connection details and table/column names with your actual database structure.\n\nThis is a basic implementation, and you might want to add features like:\n\n- Input validation\n- Error handling\n- Pagination for search results\n- Search by multiple columns\n- Sorting options\n- Highlighting search terms in results\n- Loading indicators during search\n- Auto-suggest functionality", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Search Bar</title>\n    <style>\n        .search-container {\n            max-width: 500px;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        .search-bar {\n            width: 100%;\n            padding: 10px;\n            font-size: 16px;\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            border-radius: 4px;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"search-container\">\n        <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"POST\">\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"search_query\" class=\"search-bar\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Search\" style=\"padding: 10px; font-size: 16px;\">\n        </form>\n    </div>\n\n    <?php\n    // Check if the form has been submitted\n    if (isset($_POST['search_query'])) {\n        $search_query = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['search_query']));\n        \n        // Here you would typically connect to your database and perform a search query\n        // For this example, we'll just display the search results mock-up\n        \n        // Mock search results\n        $results = array(\n            \"Result 1 related to: $search_query\",\n            \"Result 2 related to: $search_query\",\n            \"Result 3 related to: $search_query\"\n        );\n        \n        echo \"<h3>Search Results for '$search_query'</h3>\";\n        foreach ($results as $result) {\n            echo \"<p>$result</p>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Show this message when no search has been performed yet\n        echo \"<h3>Welcome!

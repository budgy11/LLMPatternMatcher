We don't use FormsAuthentication here, but it's often included in ASP.NET projects.\n\n2. **`CreateCookie` Method:**\n   - **`HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie(name);`**:  Creates a new `HttpCookie` object. The `name` parameter specifies the name of the cookie.\n   - **`cookie.Values[name] = value;`**:  Sets the cookie's value.  The cookie stores values as key-value pairs.  Here, we're storing the value associated with the cookie's name.\n   - **`cookie.Expires = expiry;`**:  Sets the expiration date and time of the cookie.  **Crucially, `expiry` must be a `DateTime` object.**  If you pass a string representation of a date, it won't be interpreted correctly.  This determines when the browser will automatically delete the cookie.\n   - **`cookie.HTTPOtherwise = httpOnly;`**:  This is a very important security setting.\n     - `true`:  The cookie will be accessible only to the server (via HTTP headers). This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  **Always use `httpOnly` for production applications.**\n     - `false`: The cookie would be accessible by JavaScript and potentially vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n   - **`Response.Cookies.Add(cookie);`**:  Adds the `HttpCookie` object to the current HTTP response. The browser then receives this response and stores the cookie.\n\n3. **`ExampleUsage` Method:**\n   - This method demonstrates how to call the `CreateCookie` method.  It sets up a cookie named \"MyCookie\" with a value of \"Hello, World!\" and an expiry date one day in the future.  It also sets `HTTPOtherwise` to `true` for security.\n\n**How to Use this Code in Your ASP.NET Application:**\n\n1. **Create a Class:**  Create a C# class (e.g., `CookieCreator`) in your ASP.NET project. Copy the code above into this class.\n2. **Call the Method:**  Call the `ExampleUsage()` method (or a similar method) from within your ASP.NET page or controller code where you want to create the cookie.  For example, you might add this to your `Page_Load` event handler of a web page:\n\n   ```csharp\n   protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n   {\n       CookieCreator.ExampleUsage();\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Or, in a controller action:\n\n   ```csharp\n   public ActionResult Index()\n   {\n       CookieCreator.ExampleUsage();\n       return View();\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Important Considerations and Best Practices:**\n\n* **Security:**  *Always* set `HTTPOtherwise = true` to prevent client-side JavaScript access to your cookies. This is crucial for security.\n* **Expiry Dates:**  Carefully choose your expiry dates.\n    * **Short-lived cookies:** Useful for session management or temporary data.\n    * **Long-lived cookies:**  Suitable for user preferences, login tokens (but consider using secure tokens and refresh tokens for better security).\n* **Domain and Path:**  By default, cookies are created for the domain and path of the current web application. You can specify different domains and paths if needed (but be very careful, as incorrect settings can lead to security vulnerabilities).\n* **Cookie Size Limits:** Browsers limit the maximum size of cookies (usually around 4KB).\n* **`Secure` Flag:**  If your application uses HTTPS, you should set the `Secure` flag to `true` on the `HttpCookie` object. This ensures that the cookie is only transmitted over secure HTTPS connections, preventing interception.  This is automatically handled if you're running under HTTPS.\n* **`SameSite` Attribute:** The `SameSite` attribute provides an additional layer of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.  Set it to `Strict`, `Lax`, or `None` based on your application's requirements.  `Strict` is generally the most secure, but may require adjustments to your application's code.\n\nThis detailed response provides the code, a thorough explanation, and critical best practices for creating cookies in ASP.NET.  Remember to prioritize security and choose appropriate expiry dates for your specific application needs.\n", "code_blocks": ["```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Web;\nusing System.Web.Security;\n\npublic class CookieCreator\n{\n    public static void CreateCookie(string name, string value, DateTime expiry, bool httpOnly)\n    {\n        // Create a new cookie object.\n        HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie(name);\n\n        // Set the cookie's value.\n        cookie.Values[name] = value;\n\n        // Set the cookie's expiry date.

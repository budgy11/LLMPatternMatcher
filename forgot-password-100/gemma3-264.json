This is absolutely essential.  Storing raw tokens is extremely insecure; attackers can easily steal them.  Using `password_hash()` provides a secure, salted hashing mechanism.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` is generally the most robust option.\n    * **Random Token Generation:**  Uses `random_bytes()` which is the most secure way to generate random bytes in PHP.  Then, `bin2hex()` is used to convert the bytes to a hexadecimal string, providing a standard and reliable representation of the token.\n* **Database Interaction:**\n    * **Prepared Statements:** The code *must* use prepared statements with parameterized queries (using `$db->prepare()` and `bind_param()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is a standard security practice.\n    * **Error Handling (Implicit):**  The `execute()` method will implicitly throw an exception if the query fails, which is a basic level of error handling. More robust error handling (e.g., checking `$stmt->execute()`'s return value) is recommended in a production environment.\n* **Clearer Function Structure:** The code is organized into two functions, `forgot_password()` and `generate_unique_token()`, making it more modular and easier to understand.\n* **Email Sending (Illustrative):** The email sending code is included as a placeholder.  *You must replace the placeholder with your actual email sending logic.*  This example shows how to generate the email message and headers, but you'll need to integrate it with a proper email sending library or service.\n* **`base_url`:**  The `base_url` is used to construct the reset link, assuming you have a base URL defined (e.g., from `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`).\n* **`get_setting('noreply_email')`:**  The code now uses a `get_setting()` function (you'll need to define this) to retrieve the \"noreply_email\" setting from your configuration file. This is much better than hardcoding the email address.\n* **Clearer Comments and Documentation:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.\n* **`num_rows > 0` check:** Checks the result of the query to make sure a user was found.\n* **Example Usage (Commented Out):**  The example usage is commented out to prevent accidental execution when you're not testing.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **`db_connect.php`:**  You'll need to create this file (or a similar file) with your database connection details. This file should establish the connection to your database.\n\n2. **`get_setting()` Function:** You'll need to define a `get_setting()` function that retrieves settings from your configuration file.\n\n3. **Email Sending Implementation:**  Replace the placeholder email sending code with a reliable email sending library or service (e.g., PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, or a service like SendGrid or Mailgun).  This is the most complex part.\n\n4. **Password Reset Link Validation:**  **Crucially, you MUST implement a mechanism to validate the reset link when a user clicks it.** This involves:\n   * Verifying that the `token` in the URL is valid (i.e., exists in the `password_resets` table, has not expired, and has not been used before).\n   *  Potentially, adding an expiration time to the token (e.g., 30 minutes) to enhance security.\n\n5. **Password Reset Form:** Create a form for users to enter their email addresses and trigger the password reset process.\n\n6. **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling to catch and display errors gracefully.\n\n7. **Security Audits:**  Regularly review and audit your code for security vulnerabilities.\n\n8. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the password reset functionality.\n\n9. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire password reset flow, including successful resets, failed attempts, and error handling.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and functional foundation for your password reset function. Remember to prioritize security and thorough testing throughout the development process.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Include your database connection file\nrequire_once 'db_connect.php'; // Assuming you have a db_connect.php file with your database connection details\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user.\n * @return bool True if a password reset email was sent, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgot_password($email)\n{\n  global $db; // Access the database connection\n\n  // Check if the email exists\n  $query = \"SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = ?\";\n  $stmt = $db->prepare($query);\n  $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $email);\n  $stmt->execute();\n  $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n  if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n    $user_id = $result->fetch_assoc()['id'];\n    $reset_token = generate_unique_token();\n    $reset_timestamp = time(); // Store the timestamp when the token was generated\n\n    // Hash the token (important for security!)\n    $hashed_token = password_hash($reset_token, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n\n    // Store the token in the database\n    $query = \"INSERT INTO password_resets (user_id, token, reset_timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\";\n    $stmt = $db->prepare($query);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"iii\", $user_id, $hashed_token, $reset_timestamp);\n    $stmt->execute();\n\n    // Send the password reset email\n    $to = $email;\n    $subject = 'Password Reset';\n    $message = \"Please click on the following link to reset your password: <a href='\" . base_url .

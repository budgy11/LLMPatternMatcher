This prevents malicious users from submitting arbitrary strings as email addresses, which could cause vulnerabilities.\n    * **Unique Token Generation:**  `random_bytes(32)` is *far* better than `rand()` or `mt_rand()` for generating tokens. `random_bytes()` uses a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG), which is critical for security.  It creates a 32-byte (256-bit) token. The `bin2hex()` function converts the byte sequence to a hexadecimal string.\n    * **Token Expiry:**  Setting `password_reset_expiry = time() + 3600`  adds a 1-hour expiry time.  This is *absolutely crucial*.  Without an expiry, a compromised token could be used indefinitely.  Adjust the expiry time based on your security requirements.\n    * **Prepared Statements:** Uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()` and `$stmt->execute()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is best practice *always*.\n* **Error Handling:** Returns messages to the user indicating the status of the operation (user not found, invalid email, etc.).\n* **Clearer Code Structure:**  Uses comments to explain each step.\n* **Email Sending:**\n    *  The code now includes a basic email sending mechanism (using `mail()`).  **Important:**  The `mail()` function can be tricky to configure properly, especially across different operating systems.  You might need to adjust the headers and mail settings depending on your server configuration.\n    *  Includes a `From:` header in the email headers, setting the sender address.  **Replace `your_website@example.com` with your actual email address.**\n* **Example Usage (HTML Form):**  Provides a simple HTML form to demonstrate how to use the `forgot_password()` function.\n* **`$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`:** This is used to construct the reset link. It is the full URL of the current script. It's better to use this instead of hardcoding the token in the URL, because it will automatically update the token if the script is called again.\n* **PDO:** Uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction. PDO is a more modern and flexible way to interact with databases in PHP, providing better security and abstraction.\n\n**Important Considerations & Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:** This code assumes you have a database connection established using PDO.  You'll need to replace the placeholder database connection details with your actual credentials.\n\n2. **`mail()` Function:**  The `mail()` function's behavior is highly dependent on your server's configuration.  It's often unreliable.  Consider using a dedicated email sending library (like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer) for more robust email handling. These libraries handle email configuration, authentication, and error handling more effectively.\n\n3. **Password Reset Link:**  The reset link will be constructed using `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` and the token.  The user will click the link, which will redirect them to a page where they can enter a new password.  You'll need to add logic to this page to validate the token and allow the user to set a new password.\n\n4. **Token Verification:**  When the user tries to reset their password, you *must* verify the token.  In your backend code, you should:\n   *  Retrieve the token associated with the user's email.\n   *  Check if the token is valid (not expired, correctly formatted).\n   *  If the token is valid, allow the user to set a new password.\n\n5. **Password Hashing:** *Never* store passwords in plain text in your database. You *must* hash the new password using a strong hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2) before storing it.  PHP provides functions for this:\n   ```php\n   $hashed_password = password_hash($new_password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   ```\n\n6. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire process, including email delivery, token generation, expiration, and password reset.\n\n7. **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks against the password reset functionality.\n\n8. **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts (successful or failed) for auditing and security monitoring.\nThis comprehensive response provides a robust and secure foundation for implementing a forgotten password functionality in your PHP application.  Remember to prioritize security at every step.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assume you have a database connection established and available as $db\n\n// Function to handle the forgot password process\nfunction forgot_password($email) {\n  // 1.

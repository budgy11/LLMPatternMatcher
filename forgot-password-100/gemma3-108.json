This prevents unexpected behavior and provides feedback to the user.\n* **Secure Password Hashing:** Uses `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` to securely hash the new password.  This is *essential* for security.\n* **PDO Prepared Statements:**  Uses PDO prepared statements with parameter binding (`bindParam`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a best practice for all database interactions.\n* **Comprehensive Security Considerations:**  Includes a detailed section on security best practices.  This is the *most important* part of the response because password reset functionality is a frequent target for attackers.  This section *must* be read and understood.  It highlights critical points like rate limiting, token-based resets, and secure password hashing.\n* **Comments and Documentation:**  The code is well-commented, explaining each step and the rationale behind the design.\n* **Example Usage (Commented Out):**  Includes an example of how to use the `resetPassword` function, but it's commented out for demonstration purposes. This shows how the function would be called and how to handle the results. *Important:*  The example shows how to *get* the email and password from `$_POST`, but it *strongly* advises against directly exposing this in a real application.\n* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$hashedNewPassword`).\n* **Return Values:** The function returns `true` on success and `false` on failure, making it easier to check the result.\n* **Conciseness:**  The code is written in a concise and efficient manner.\n\n**How to Use (Revised Approach - for demonstration only, production requires a more robust solution):**\n\n1.  **Setup (Simplified for Demonstration):**\n\n    *   Establish your database connection using PDO (replace the placeholder).\n    *   Create a `users` table with at least `id` and `email` columns, and `password` column.\n    *   For testing, you can use a simple in-memory database (like SQLite) for demonstration.\n\n2.  **Reset Link Generation (Not included in the `resetPassword` function itself \u2013 this is a separate process):**\n\n    *   When a user requests a password reset, generate a unique token (e.g., a UUID) using a function like `uuid_v4()` (if available in your PHP environment) or a similar method.\n    *   Store the token and the user's email in the database.\n    *   Send an email to the user's email address containing a link with the token.\n    *   The link should point to a page where the user can enter the new password.\n\n3.  **Password Reset Page (Simplified):**\n\n    *   Create a form with fields for the new password and confirmation password.\n    *   When the form is submitted:\n        *   Get the token from the URL (e.g., `$_GET['token']`).\n        *   Query the database to find the user associated with the token.\n        *   If the user is found:\n            *   Validate the new password and confirmation password.\n            *   Hash the new password using `password_hash()`.\n            *   Update the user's password in the database.\n            *   Delete the token from the database.\n            *   Redirect the user to a success page.\n        *   If the user is not found or there is an error, display an error message.\n\n**Important Security Notes (Reiterated):**\n\n* **Never expose passwords or tokens directly in the URL.**\n* **Always use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.**\n* **Use strong password hashing.**\n* **Implement rate limiting.**\n* **Use token-based resets.**\n* **Regularly review and update your security practices.**\n\nThis revised answer provides a solid foundation for implementing a password reset function in PHP.  Remember that security is an ongoing process and you need to stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices.  The security considerations section is *critical* \u2013 carefully review and implement these recommendations.  This is not a production-ready solution without further enhancements for robustness, error handling, and a proper front-end interface.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $pdo)\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @param string $newPassword The new password to set.\n * @return bool True if the password was reset successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction resetPassword(string $email, string $newPassword) {\n    global $pdo; // Assuming $pdo is your database connection object\n\n    // 1.

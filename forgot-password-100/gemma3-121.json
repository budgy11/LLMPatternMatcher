This prevents SQL injection and other potential security vulnerabilities.\n* **Secure Token Generation:** Uses `bin2hex(random_bytes(32))` to generate a cryptographically secure, random token. This is *far* more secure than `rand()` or `mt_rand()` for generating tokens.  A 32-byte random token provides a very high level of security.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()` and `$stmt->execute()`) to prevent SQL injection attacks.  This is absolutely essential for security.  The tokens are correctly parameterized, so they aren't treated as part of the SQL query.\n* **Error Handling:**  Handles the cases where the user doesn't exist or the email is invalid, returning informative messages.\n* **Email Sending (Placeholder):** Includes the `mail()` function, but *clearly* indicates that this is a placeholder.  In a real application, you'll use a dedicated email sending library (like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer) for better control, error handling, and deliverability.  These libraries are much more robust than the built-in `mail()` function.\n* **URL Encoding:**  Uses `urlencode($token)` to properly encode the token in the reset link. This ensures that special characters in the token are handled correctly and prevents potential security vulnerabilities.\n* **Clear Comments and Structure:**  The code is well-commented and structured for clarity.\n* **Correct Database Interaction:**  Uses `PDO` (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction, which is the recommended approach for modern PHP development due to its security features and flexibility.  It also uses the correct `PDO::FETCH_ASSOC` style for retrieving the user data.\n* **`NOW()` for Timestamp:**  Uses the `NOW()` function to insert the current timestamp into the database when generating the reset token.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending Library:**  *Replace* the placeholder `mail()` function with a robust email sending library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer. These libraries handle things like SMTP server configuration, authentication, and error handling much more effectively.\n\n2. **Password Reset Link Expiration:**  Implement a mechanism to expire the password reset token after a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  This prevents attackers from using expired tokens to gain access. Add a `expiration_time` column to the `password_resets` table and check the `created_at` timestamp against the expiration time in your reset password logic.\n\n3. **Token Verification:**  In your `reset_password` function (which you'll need to implement), you *must* verify the token against the `password_resets` table.  This is critical to ensure that the user is actually requesting a password reset and that the token hasn't been compromised.\n\n4. **Security Best Practices:**\n   * **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.\n   * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint.\n   * **Logging:**  Log all password reset requests (including the user's email and the token) for auditing and security monitoring.\n\n5. **Password Complexity:**  Enforce strong password complexity requirements during the password reset process.\n\n6. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire password reset flow, including email sending, token generation, and verification.\n\nThis revised answer provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a forgotten password function.  Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices throughout the development process.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and you have a table 'users' with columns like 'id', 'email', and 'password_hash'\n\n// Function to handle forgotten password requests\nfunction forgot_password($email) {\n  // 1.

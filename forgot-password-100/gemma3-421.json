This is absolutely vital for security.  Storing passwords in plain text is extremely dangerous.  `password_hash()` uses a strong hashing algorithm and a salt to protect the password.\n* **PDO for Database Interaction:** Uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction.  PDO is the standard and recommended way to interact with databases in PHP because it's more flexible, secure, and supports multiple database systems.  It also handles connection closing better than older methods.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes a basic check to see if the email exists in the database.  This prevents errors and returns `false` if the email is not found. More robust error handling (e.g., using `try...catch` blocks) would be appropriate for a production application to catch potential database errors.\n* **Prepared Statements (SQL Injection Prevention):**  Uses prepared statements with placeholders (`?`).  This is *essential* to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Prepared statements separate the SQL code from the data, ensuring that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL query.\n* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$hashedNewPassword`) for better readability.\n* **Comprehensive Comments:** Includes detailed comments to explain each step of the process.\n* **Example Usage:** Provides a clear example of how to use the `forgotPassword()` function.  *Important:* The example uses hardcoded data for demonstration only.  **Do not use this exact example in a production environment.**\n* **Clearer Structure:** The code is structured logically, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n* **`PDO::FETCH_ASSOC`:**  Uses `PDO::FETCH_ASSOC` when fetching data from the database. This returns an associative array, which is generally easier to work with than a numeric indexed array.\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:** You need a database (e.g., MySQL) with a `users` table. The table should have at least an `id` column (integer), an `email` column (string), and a `password` column (string).\n\n2. **Database Connection:**  Replace the placeholder database credentials (`'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=your_database_name', 'your_username', 'your_password'`) with your actual database connection details.\n\n3. **Table Structure:** Make sure your `users` table has the appropriate columns (at least `id`, `email`, and `password`).\n\n4. **Form Integration:** You'll need to integrate this `forgotPassword()` function into a form on your website. The form should:\n   - Take the user's email address.\n   - Take a new password from the user.\n   - Call `forgotPassword()` with the email and the new password.\n   - Display a success or error message to the user.\n\n5. **Security Considerations (Beyond this example):**\n   - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n   - **Email Verification:** Send a verification email to the user after they reset their password, requiring them to confirm the new password.\n   - **Session Management:** Use secure session management techniques to protect user sessions.\n   - **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit your code and database to identify and address security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis improved version provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function.  Remember to prioritize security best practices in your implementation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assume you have a database connection established and defined as $db\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user.\n * @param string $newPassword The new password to set.\n * @return bool True if password reset successful, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email, string $newPassword) {\n  // 1.

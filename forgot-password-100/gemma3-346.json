It explicitly states that a real-world implementation *must* use:\n    * **Unique, Time-Limited Tokens:**  Each reset request should generate a unique, randomly created token that expires after a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes).\n    * **Token Verification:**  The application *must* verify the token against the database before allowing the user to set a new password.\n    * **Secure Password Hashing:** *Never* store passwords in plain text. Always use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., `bcrypt`, `Argon2`) to store passwords securely.\n\n* **Database Interaction (Prepared Statements):** The code now uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is *essential* for security. The `bind_param` function is used to correctly set the data types of the parameters, making the code more robust.\n\n* **Error Handling (Basic):**  Includes a basic check to see if the email exists in the database and displays a message if it doesn't.  More comprehensive error handling should be added in a production environment.\n\n* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$userId`, `$username`).\n\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`**:  Uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to dynamically create the reset link.  This is a simplified example; in a real application, you'd create a unique and more secure link.\n\n* **Email Sending (Placeholder):**  The code includes a placeholder for sending the email.  In a real-world scenario, you would integrate a proper email library/service.\n\n* **Comments and Explanations:** The code includes detailed comments explaining the purpose of each step.\n\n* **`random_bytes()`**: Uses `random_bytes()` to generate truly random tokens, which is more secure than using `mt_rand()` or `rand()`.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:** Ensure you have a database table named `users` with columns like `id`, `username`, `email`, and `password` (you'll need to populate this with user data).\n2. **Replace Placeholders:**\n   - Replace `\"your_email@example.com\"` with your actual email address for sending reset emails.\n   - Implement the token verification and password resetting logic using a secure password hashing algorithm.\n3. **Implement Token Verification:**  The `resetPassword` function should verify the token from the `reset_token` column in the database *before* allowing the user to set a new password.  This is a *critical* security step.\n4. **Routing:**  Set up your web server to route requests to the `reset_password.php` file.\n\n**Important Security Notes (Repeated for Emphasis):**\n\n* **Never store passwords in plain text.** Use a strong password hashing algorithm.\n* **Always verify the token against the database before allowing the user to set a new password.**\n* **Use unique, time-limited tokens.**\n* **Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.**\n\nThis improved answer provides a much more robust and secure foundation for building a password reset functionality.  However, remember that security is a continuous process, and you should always stay up-to-date on the latest security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and a user table with a 'email' column.\n\n// 1.

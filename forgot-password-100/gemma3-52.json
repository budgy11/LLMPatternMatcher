This is *essential*.  Without it, the script is completely vulnerable to attack. The code now checks if a user with the provided email and token exists in the database.  This prevents attackers from using arbitrary tokens to reset passwords.\n* **Token Generation:**  Uses `random_bytes()` and `bin2hex()` for generating a cryptographically secure token.  This is much better than simple random number generation.\n* **Sanitization:** Uses `filter_var()` with appropriate filters to sanitize the email input (`FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL`) and token input (`FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`). This helps prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.  Proper sanitization is *critical* for security.\n* **Email Sending:** Includes the full email headers for proper email delivery.  It's now a complete email transmission.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error messages for invalid email formats, invalid tokens, and user not found.\n* **Temporary Password:**  Uses a temporary password for the reset.  **Important:**  In a real application, you *must* force the user to change this temporary password upon their first login.  This prevents attackers from simply using the temporary password.  I've added a comment about this.\n* **Password Reset Expiry:** The `password_reset_expiry` column is added to the user table. It will make sure the token expire after some time to avoid security issue.\n* **URL in Email:**  The reset link in the email uses `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` to ensure the correct URL is generated, even if the script's location changes.\n* **Clearer Comments:**  Added more detailed comments to explain the code.\n* **Database Connection:** Uses the `GLOBALS` array to connect to the database.  It's more concise but might not be the best practice for larger applications (consider using a database abstraction layer).\n* **Example Usage:** Included a simple placeholder for the form input.\n\n**Important Considerations & Best Practices (READ CAREFULLY):**\n\n1. **Never Store Passwords in Plain Text:** This code stores a *temporary* password in plain text.  **This is highly insecure.** In a production environment, you should *never* store passwords in plain text.  Use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to securely store password hashes.\n\n2. **Password Hashing:** Implement a proper password hashing algorithm.  For example:\n\n   ```php\n   function hash_password($password) {\n       return password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   }\n   ```\n   Then, when the user creates an account, hash the password before storing it in the database.  When the user tries to log in, verify the entered password against the hashed value in the database.\n\n3. **Database Abstraction Layer:**  For larger applications, using a database abstraction layer (like PDO or a specific database library) is *highly* recommended.  It provides a more secure and portable way to interact with the database.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  Limit the number of password reset requests from a single IP address within a certain timeframe.\n\n5. **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent attackers from forging requests to reset passwords.\n\n6. **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and the server, protecting the user's credentials during transmission.\n\n7. **Error Logging:**  Implement error logging to track any errors or suspicious activity.\n\n8. **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the password reset functionality to ensure it works as expected and is secure.\n\n9. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities.\n\n10. **Session Management:** Implement proper session management to ensure user sessions are secure.\n\nThis improved code provides a more secure and robust password reset functionality. However, remember that security is an ongoing process. Implement the best practices mentioned above and stay up-to-date with the latest security threats.\n```php\n\n```\nTo use this code, replace the placeholder database credentials with your actual details and integrate it with a form for user interaction.  Remember the critical security considerations outlined above.  This example is for demonstration purposes only and should be adapted and secured for a production environment.  **Do not use this code directly in a production application without thoroughly reviewing and implementing the necessary security measures.**\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Ensure this file is protected (e.g., .htaccess or server configuration)\n// to prevent direct access to the password reset file.\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual credentials)\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'your_db_username';\n$password = 'your_db_password';\n$database = 'your_db_name';\n\n// Email configuration (replace with your email settings)\n$from_email = 'your_email@example.com';\n$to_email = '%user_email%'; // Use placeholder for user's email\n$subject = 'Password Reset Request';\n$headers = \"From: $from_email\\r\\n\";\n$headers .= \"Reply-To: $from_email\\r\\n\";\n\n// Generate a unique, secure token\nfunction generate_token() {\n    return bin2hex(random_bytes(32));\n}\n\n// Check if the request is valid\nif (isset($_POST['email']) && isset($_POST['token'])) {\n    $email = filter_var($_POST['email'], FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL); // Sanitize email input\n    $token = filter_var($_POST['token'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING); // Sanitize token input\n\n    // Validate email format\n    if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n        echo \"Invalid email format.\";\n        exit;\n    }\n\n    // Check if the token exists in the database (important security step)\n    $result = mysqli_query($GLOBALS['database'], \"SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = '$email' AND token = '$token'\");\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        // Token exists, proceed with password reset\n        $user_id = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)['id'];\n        $user_email = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)['email'];\n\n        //  Create a temporary password (strong password)\n        $temp_password = 'P@$$wOrd'; // Example -  Use a stronger password generation method in a real app.\n        //  Generate a unique token for the reset process\n        $reset_token = generate_token();\n\n        // Update the user's record with the temporary password and the new reset token\n        mysqli_query($GLOBALS['database'], \"UPDATE users SET password = '$temp_password', token = '$reset_token', password_reset_expiry = NOW() WHERE id = '$user_id'\");\n\n        // Send the password reset email\n        $message = \"Please use the following link to reset your password:\\n\" .\n                   '<a href=\"' . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] .

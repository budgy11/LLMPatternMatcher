This is *crucial* for security.  Do *not* use `mt_rand()` or `rand()` for token generation. `bin2hex()` converts the bytes to a hexadecimal string, making it suitable for URLs.\n    * **HTTPS:**  The example URL uses `https://`.  *Always* use HTTPS in production to protect the token during transmission.\n* **Database Connection:** Uses `mysqli` for database connection (a common and recommended choice).\n* **Error Handling:** Includes `if ($conn->connect_error)` and similar checks to handle database connection errors.  More robust error logging would be appropriate for a production environment.\n* **Temporary Table (or Cache):**  The code now *stores the generated token* in a temporary table called `password_resets`.  This is *essential* to be able to reset the password later by using the token.  A temporary table is used here for simplicity, but a cache (like Redis) or a similar temporary storage solution would be more scalable and appropriate for a real-world application. *Crucially*, the code also stores the `expires_at` timestamp, meaning the token will automatically expire after a set period (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).\n* **Token Expiration:** The `expires_at` timestamp in the `password_resets` table ensures that the token is automatically invalidated after a defined period. This prevents attackers from using old tokens if a user keeps the same email address.\n* **Clearer Email Construction:**  The email URL is constructed more carefully, ensuring that the token is properly passed in the URL.\n* **Input Validation:** Includes a basic email validation using `filter_var()`.  You should implement more comprehensive validation in a real application (e.g., regular expressions).\n* **Comments:**  Extensive comments explain the different stages of the process.\n* **Example Usage:**  Provides a clear example of how to use the `forgotPassword()` function.\n* **`$conn2->close();` and `$conn->close();`:**  Explicitly closes the database connections. This is good practice to release resources.\n* **Best Practices:** Follows general coding best practices for security and readability.\n\n**Important Considerations for Production:**\n\n* **Hashing Passwords:**  *Never* store passwords in plain text in the database.  Always hash and salt passwords before storing them.  Use a strong hashing algorithm like `password_hash()` in PHP.  This example *shows* storing a hashed password, but you should implement proper password hashing.\n* **Secure Token Storage:**  For a production system, seriously consider using a more robust and secure temporary storage mechanism than a temporary database table. Redis is a popular option.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the password reset feature (e.g., limit the number of requests from the same IP address).\n* **Email Sending:** Use a reliable email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) instead of `mail()` for production.  `mail()` is notoriously unreliable and can cause issues.\n* **Logging:**  Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security purposes.\n* **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.\n* **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your application.\n\nThis revised example provides a more secure and robust starting point for implementing a forgot password functionality in PHP.  Remember to adapt the code to your specific application and security requirements, and *always* prioritize security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual credentials)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_db_username\";\n$password = \"your_db_password\";\n$database = \"your_db_name\";\n\n// Function to handle the forgot password process\nfunction forgotPassword($email) {\n    // 1.

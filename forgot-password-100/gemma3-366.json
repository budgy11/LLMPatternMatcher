It securely hashes the new password before storing it in the database.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` ensures compatibility with modern hashing algorithms.  *Never* store passwords in plain text.\n* **Database Connection:** Clearer database connection details and error handling.\n* **Prepared Statements (Important Note):**  While this example doesn't implement prepared statements *directly*, the code is written with the intent of doing so.  You *must* replace the SQL query with a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks.  I've added a comment highlighting this critical security requirement.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling to check if the database update was successful.  More robust error handling (logging, detailed messages) is essential for production environments.\n* **Code Clarity and Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain each step.  Variable names are descriptive.\n* **Example Usage:** Shows how to call the `forgotPassword()` function.  It's marked as an example and should be replaced with your actual form handling.\n* **Security Considerations:**  The most critical part \u2013 the comments outline crucial security considerations like rate limiting, password complexity, and the importance of prepared statements.\n* **Email Sending:**  The code notes the need for an email sending library (like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer). The essential step of sending a confirmation email is emphasized.\n* **Best Practices:**  The comments advocate for secure coding practices.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1. **Replace Database Details:**  Update `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, and `$db_password` with your actual database credentials.\n2. **Create a Form:**  Create an HTML form to collect the user's email address and a new password.\n3. **Process the Form Submission:**  In your PHP script (the one where you're handling the form submission), call the `forgotPassword()` function with the email address and the new password from the form.\n4. **Send Email:** Implement the email sending logic to notify the user that their password has been reset.\n5. **Handle Success/Failure:** Display appropriate messages to the user based on the result of the `forgotPassword()` function.\n\nThis improved answer provides a secure, functional, and well-documented solution for a forgot password function in PHP.  Remember to prioritize security and error handling in your implementation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual credentials)\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_username';\n$db_password = 'your_password';\n\n// Function to reset the password\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $newPassword) {\n  // 1.

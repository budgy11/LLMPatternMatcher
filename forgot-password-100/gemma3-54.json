It automatically handles salting, which is a vital security component.  It also provides a way to verify passwords during login.\n\n* **PDO for Database Interaction:** Uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) which is the recommended way to interact with databases in modern PHP applications.  It provides a consistent interface and supports various database drivers.\n\n* **Error Handling:** Includes `try...catch` blocks for PDO to gracefully handle database connection errors and other exceptions.  This prevents the script from crashing and provides a more informative error message.\n\n* **Input Validation:**  `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`  is used to validate the email format.  This prevents the script from attempting to insert invalid data into the database, which could cause errors or vulnerabilities.  It checks if the input is a valid email address format.\n\n* **Clearer Code and Comments:**  The code is more readable and well-commented, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n\n* **Database Connection Closure:** ` $db = null;` is added to close the database connection after usage. This is crucial for releasing resources and preventing potential connection leaks.\n\n* **Prepared Statements (Crucial for Security):** The code now uses prepared statements with `PDO::prepare()` and `PDO::execute()`. This is *essential* for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities. Prepared statements treat user input as data, not as part of the SQL query itself, thus mitigating the risk of malicious code being injected into your database.\n\n* **Complete and runnable example:**  The example is now a complete, runnable script (once you fill in your database credentials).  It includes a basic demonstration of how to call the `forgot_password` function and display the result.  **Important:**  This example is for demonstration and testing purposes only.  It should *not* be used in a production environment without proper security measures and input sanitization.\n\n* **Removed deprecated features:**  This example avoids using older, deprecated features like `mysql_*` functions, which are known to have security vulnerabilities and are no longer recommended.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:** Update the `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, and `$db_password` variables with your actual database credentials.\n2. **Create a Form:** Create an HTML form to collect the user's email address and the new password.  The form should submit the data using the POST method.\n3. **Implement the Form:**  Add HTML form elements (`<input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\">`, `<input type=\"password\" id=\"new_password\" name=\"new_password\">`) to the HTML page.\n4. **Process the Form Data:**  Handle the form submission in your PHP code (e.g., using `$_POST`).\n5. **Call the `forgot_password` function:**  Pass the user's email and the new password to the `forgot_password` function.\n6. **Display the Result:**  Display the result of the function call to the user.  This could be a success message or an error message.\n7. **Send a Password Reset Email:**  The `forgot_password` function *doesn't* send the email.  You need to add code to send an email with a link that the user can use to reset their password.  Use a reliable email sending library or service for this.\n   * **Token:** Generate a unique, time-limited token for the password reset link.  Store this token in the database, associated with the user's email.  Include the token in the password reset link.\n   * **Expiration:**  Set an expiration time for the token to prevent abuse.\n   * **Email Content:**  The email should contain a link that looks something like this: `https://yourwebsite.com/reset_password.php?token=your_token_value`\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Email Sending:**  Use a secure email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) to send password reset emails.  Do *not* rely on your own email server for sending password reset emails, as this can be a security risk.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  Limit the number of password reset requests that can be made from a single IP address within a certain time period.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Consider implementing 2FA for added security.\n* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your application and database.\n* **Keep Software Updated:**  Keep your PHP version and database drivers up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised answer provides a much more secure and robust solution for implementing a password reset functionality in your PHP application. Remember to always prioritize security and follow best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual credentials)\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_username';\n$db_password = 'your_password';\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgot_password($email, $new_password, $db) {\n    // 1.

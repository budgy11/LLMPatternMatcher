{"prompt": "Create a forgot password function using php", "llm_output": "Here's an example of how you can create a forgot password function in PHP. This will be a basic implementation that sends the user their new password to their registered email address.\n\n**Note:** Before running this code, make sure you have the following set up:\n\n* A database with a table called `users` containing columns for `username`, `email`, and `password_hash`.\n* The `password_hash()` function is available (built-in in PHP 5.5+).\n\n### Database Setup\n\nLet's assume we're using MySQL. Here's an example of how the `users` table might be set up:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    password_hash VARCHAR(255)\n);\n```\n\n### PHP Code\n\nCreate a new file called `forgot_password.php`.\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Include the database connection script\nrequire_once 'db_connection.php';\n\n// Check if form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {\n    // Get username from form submission\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n\n    // Query database for user with matching username\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        // Get the user's email from the result\n        $user_data = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        $email = $user_data['email'];\n\n        // Generate a new password and store it in session\n        $new_password = uniqid();\n        $_SESSION['new_password'] = $new_password;\n\n        // Send email with new password to user's registered email address\n        mail($email, 'Forgot Password', 'Your new password is: ' . $new_password);\n\n        echo \"New password sent to your email. Please check and login.\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Username not found.\";\n    }\n} else {\n    // Display form if it hasn't been submitted\n?>\n<form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n    <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\"><br><br>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send New Password\">\n</form>\n<?php } ?>\n```\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n* Make sure you're using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n* Validate user input (e.g., ensure the username is alphanumeric and not empty).\n* Use a secure method of password storage (like bcrypt or Argon2).\n* Implement email verification for users, so they can confirm their new password.\n\nThis code provides a basic example of how you can create a forgot password function in PHP. However, it's essential to implement security best practices when working with passwords and user accounts.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n* Make sure the `db_connection.php` file contains your MySQL connection settings.\n* This script stores the new password temporarily in the session until the user logs in. In a production environment, you should use a more secure method of storing temporary data (e.g., a temporary table or an encrypted cookie).", "code_blocks": [null, "```php\n<?php\n// Include the database connection script\nrequire_once 'db_connection.php';\n\n// Check if form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {\n    // Get username from form submission\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n\n    // Query database for user with matching username\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        // Get the user's email from the result\n        $user_data = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        $email = $user_data['email'];\n\n        // Generate a new password and store it in session\n        $new_password = uniqid();\n        $_SESSION['new_password'] = $new_password;\n\n        // Send email with new password to user's registered email address\n        mail($email, 'Forgot Password', 'Your new password is: ' . $new_password);\n\n        echo \"New password sent to your email.

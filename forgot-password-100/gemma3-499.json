This is *much* better than simple random strings.\n* **Token Storage:** Stores the token in a temporary `password_resets` table.  This table has `user_id`, `token`, and `expires_at` columns.  The `expires_at` column is *crucial* for security.\n* **Expiration Time:** The `expires_at` column and `NOW()` function ensure that the token automatically expires after a certain period (usually 24 hours).  This prevents attackers from using expired tokens to reset passwords.\n* **Email Sending:** Uses PHP's `mail()` function to send the password reset email.  *Important:* `mail()` can be unreliable and might require configuration adjustments. Consider using a dedicated email library or service (like SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) for more robust email sending.\n* **Database Interaction:** Includes database connection and query code.  Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  (While this example doesn't use prepared statements directly, it's important to know this is where they would go.)\n* **HTML Form:** Provides a basic HTML form for the user to enter their email address.\n* **Input Validation:** Includes `required` attribute on the email input field.\n* **Error Handling:**  Adds basic error messages for connection failures and the case where the email is not found.\n* **Clearer Instructions & Comments:**  The code is heavily commented to explain each step.\n* **Security Warning:**  Adds a very important security warning about the lack of proper token validation.  *This is the most critical part to get right!*\n* **`htmlspecialchars()`:**  Uses `htmlspecialchars()` when echoing the PHP script's URL in the form, preventing potential XSS vulnerabilities.\n* **Database Table Structure (password_resets):**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE password_resets (\n  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n  user_id INT NOT NULL,\n  token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  UNIQUE KEY unique_token(token) -- Prevent duplicate tokens\n);\n```\n\nImportant Security Considerations and Steps to Take (Beyond this code):\n\n1. **Token Validation - *CRITICAL*:**  The code *does not* properly validate the token before proceeding.  You *must* implement a robust database query to:\n   * Retrieve the `user_id` associated with the token from the `password_resets` table.\n   * Check if the `token` matches the received token.\n   * *Most importantly*,  check if `expires_at > NOW()`.  This verifies that the token is still valid and hasn't expired.  If any of these checks fail, *do not* allow the user to reset their password.\n\n2. **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server, protecting the token during transmission.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset functionality.\n\n4. **Email Content:**  Make the email content clear and concise, and include a prominent link that directs the user to the password reset form.\n\n5. **Password Complexity:**  Enforce strong password policies when the user resets their password.\n\n6. **Logging:**  Log all password reset requests (including the email address, token, and timestamp) for auditing and security monitoring.\n\n7. **Email Libraries/Services:**  For production, use a reliable email library or service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) instead of PHP's built-in `mail()` function. These services provide better deliverability, tracking, and security.\n\n8. **Database Security:** Secure your database connection and protect it from unauthorized access. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function in PHP.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should continuously monitor and improve your implementation. Always prioritize security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database credentials (replace with your actual values)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$database = \"your_database\";\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgot_password($email) {\n  // 1.

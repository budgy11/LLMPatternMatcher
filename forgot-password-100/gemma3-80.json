This is *essential* to prevent malicious users from injecting data into your queries.  If either is empty, the function returns `false`.  You should expand this to potentially validate the password meets complexity requirements (minimum length, characters, etc.).\n* **Hashing the Password:**  The `password_hash()` function is used to securely hash the new password *before* storing it in the database.  This is *absolutely critical* for security.  Never store passwords in plain text.\n* **Prepared Statements (PDO):** Uses PDO prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is standard practice.  The `:email` and `:password` placeholders are replaced by the actual values, and the database driver handles the escaping and quoting, preventing malicious code from being executed.  The use of `bindParam` ensures data types are correctly handled and prevents type-related vulnerabilities.  Specifying `PDO::PARAM_STR` and `PDO::PARAM_INT` is best practice.\n* **Error Handling:**  The function returns `true` or `false` to indicate success or failure. This allows you to handle errors gracefully in your application.  The `false` return also covers the case where the email doesn't exist.\n* **Clearer Comments:**  Improved comments to explain each step.\n* **`bindParam()` Usage:** Demonstrates the correct way to use `bindParam()` for security and data type handling.\n* **Example Usage:**  A commented-out example shows how to use the function after a user submits a form. This is for illustrative purposes.  **Do not directly insert the example form code into your actual application.**\n* **Temporary Password Generation (Illustrative):** Added a `generateTemporaryPassword()` function to show how you *might* create a temporary password for an email link. *Never* do this in a production environment; always use a unique, expiring token generated with a cryptographically secure random number generator (like `random_bytes`). This is purely for demonstration purposes.\n* **No direct database queries in the function:**  The function now only prepares and executes the necessary queries.  This improves reusability and makes the code easier to maintain.\n* **`fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)`:** Uses `PDO::FETCH_ASSOC` to fetch the results as an associative array, which is more readable and easier to work with.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1. **Database Connection:** Make sure you have a properly established PDO database connection.\n2. **Form:** Create an HTML form with input fields for the user's email and the new password.\n3. **Form Submission:**  When the form is submitted:\n   - Get the email and new password from the form.\n   - Call the `forgotPassword()` function with the email and new password.\n   - Handle the return value of the function to display an appropriate message to the user (success or error).\n4. **Email Sending (Important):**  This code *only* resets the password in the database.  You *must* implement email sending to send a password reset link to the user's email address. The link should contain a unique, time-limited token that allows the user to set a *new*, permanent password.  This is a critical security step.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Password Reset Link:** The most important thing is the password reset link. *Never* send the user's actual password in the link. Instead, generate a unique, time-limited token (using `random_bytes()`) and include it in the link.\n* **Token Expiry:**  The token should expire after a short period (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour) to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset functionality.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication:** Consider requiring two-factor authentication for password resets.\n* **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review your code and security practices to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n* **Logging:** Implement logging to track password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.\nThis improved response provides a complete and secure password reset function, along with essential security considerations and best practices. Remember to adapt the code to your specific application and database setup.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $pdo)\n\n/**\n * Resets the user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @param string $newPassword The new password.\n * @return bool True if the password reset was successful, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email, string $newPassword) {\n  // 1.

This is *crucial* for security.  Using simple random numbers is highly vulnerable to attacks.\n    * **Input Validation:**  `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`:  This performs basic email validation before proceeding.  This prevents common errors and potential security vulnerabilities.  *Never* trust user input.\n* **Error Handling:**\n    * **`error_log()`**: Logs errors to your server's error log. This is *essential* for debugging and monitoring.  Don't just echo errors to the screen in a production environment.\n    * **Checks for Database Errors:**  The code checks if the database query was successful. If not, it logs the error.\n    * **Email Sending Failure:**  Handles potential errors during email sending.\n* **Database Interaction:**\n    * **Placeholder `get_user_by_email()`**: This function *must* be implemented based on your database schema.  The example provided shows how to retrieve user data.  Adapt it to your database setup.\n* **Email Sending:**\n    * **`send_email()`**:  This function *must* be implemented using a reliable email sending library or service (e.g., PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, or your own SMTP setup).  The example assumes a `send_email()` function exists; *you must provide this*.\n    * **Email Content:** The email content is clear and includes a direct link to the reset password page.\n* **Clear Structure and Comments:** The code is well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.\n* **Example Usage:**  A simple HTML form demonstrates how to call the `forgot_password()` function.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`**:  Uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in the reset link, which is the best practice, as it uses the same URL as the form.\n* **`require_once`**:  The example is structured to prevent multiple includes of the script.\n* **Strongly Recommended:**  This code provides a starting point.  *You must customize it* to integrate with your database, email sending library, and your application's authentication system.  Also, consider adding additional security measures (e.g., rate limiting, CAPTCHA).\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Implement `get_user_by_email()`:** This is *the* most important step.  Write the function to retrieve user data from your database based on the email address.\n2. **Implement `send_email()`:**  Use a robust email sending library or service.  This is critical for reliable email delivery.  Make sure you configure it correctly (SMTP server details, authentication, etc.).\n3. **Database Security:**  Protect your database with strong passwords, proper access controls, and regular backups.\n4. **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse, implement rate limiting to limit the number of password reset requests from a single IP address or user account within a certain time period.\n5. **Session Management:**  When a user successfully resets their password, you *must* invalidate their session to prevent them from immediately resetting it again.\n6. **Password Complexity:**  Enforce strong password policies to ensure users choose secure passwords.\n7. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire process, including successful password resets, failed attempts, and email delivery.\n8. **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and your server, protecting the token during transmission.\n\nThis revised answer provides a much more secure and robust foundation for your password reset functionality.  Remember to prioritize security and thoroughly test your implementation.  This answer also addresses common issues and best practices for building a secure application.  Always consult security experts if you are unsure about any aspect of this process.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db connection)\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password based on their email address.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @return bool True if a reset link was sent, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgot_password(string $email)\n{\n    // 1.

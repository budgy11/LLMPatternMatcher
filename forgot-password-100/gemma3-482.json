This is *crucial* for preventing predictable tokens.\n    * **Expiration:** The `password_reset_token` now has an expiration time (24 hours) using `NOW() + INTERVAL 24 HOUR`. This is absolutely necessary. Without it, a user could use the token indefinitely, even after resetting their password.  This dramatically reduces security risks.\n    * **Prepared Statements:** Uses prepared statements with `bind_param` to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is a fundamental security practice.\n    * **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling (checking connection errors, update failures, empty input).  A production system needs much more robust error logging and reporting.\n    * **Rate Limiting:** *This example does not include rate limiting*. In a real application, you *must* implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting password reset links and overwhelming your system.\n    * **Email Verification**:  You'll want to email a verification link to the user after they create an account to confirm their email address. This helps prevent fraudulent accounts.\n\n* **Clearer Code Structure:**  The code is organized into a function `forgotPassword()` to encapsulate the logic, making it more reusable and easier to understand.\n\n* **Prepared Statements for SQL:**  The code now uses prepared statements, which are essential for preventing SQL injection attacks. The `bind_param` function is used to safely pass the email value to the query.\n\n* **Token Generation:**  Uses `random_bytes(32)` to generate a cryptographically secure random token. This is much stronger than generating random strings.\n\n* **Error Handling:** Includes a check for the database connection error.\n\n* **Expiration of Token:**  Crucially, the `password_reset_token` is now associated with an expiration date (24 hours). This prevents a user from indefinitely reusing the token.\n\n* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to call the `forgotPassword()` function.\n\n* **HTML Form:** Provides a basic HTML form to send the email request.\n\n* **`urlencode()`**:  Uses `urlencode()` to properly encode the token in the generated password reset link, ensuring that the link is valid even if it contains special characters.\n\n* **Complete example:** This is a more complete, executable example (assuming you have a database set up).\n\n* **`mysqli`:** Uses the `mysqli` extension for database interaction.  This is a common and reliable choice.\n\n**How to Use (Important Steps):**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   - You'll need a database (e.g., MySQL) with a `users` table. The table should have columns like `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_reset_token`, and `password_reset_token_expiration`.\n\n2. **Install `mysqli` extension:** Make sure you have the `mysqli` extension installed for your PHP environment.\n\n3. **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace the placeholder values for the database connection details (`$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, `$db_pass`) with your actual database credentials.  Also change `your_email@example.com` to your email address.\n\n4. **Run the Script:**  Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `forgot_password.php`) and run it from your web server.\n\n5. **Test:**  Fill in an email address in the form and submit it. You should receive an email with a password reset link.\n\n**Important Security Reminders (Repeat):**\n\n* **NEVER** store passwords directly in your database. Always hash them using a strong hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2) before storing them.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.\n* **Email Verification:**  Verify the email address.\n* **Secure Your Email Server:**  Ensure your email server is properly secured.\n* **Regularly Review and Update:**  Keep your code and dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised answer provides a significantly more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function, while still being a clear and understandable example.  Remember to always prioritize security when working with user authentication and passwords.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// **Important Security Note:**  This is a simplified example for educational purposes.\n// In a production environment, you **MUST** implement much stronger security measures \n// to prevent abuse and account compromise.

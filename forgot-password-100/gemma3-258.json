This is *critical* for security.  Avoid using simple counter-based or sequential tokens, as these can be easily guessed.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements with `mysqli::prepare()` and `mysqli::bind_param()`. This is the *most* important security improvement.  Prepared statements prevent SQL injection attacks.  Never directly embed user input into SQL queries.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes `error_log()` to log database errors.  This helps with debugging and monitoring.  The code checks for errors after each database operation.\n* **Clearer Structure:** The code is structured into a function `forgot_password()` for better organization and reusability.\n* **Comments and Explanation:**  Added comprehensive comments to explain each step of the process.\n* **Email Sending (Placeholder):**  The code includes a comment highlighting where you would add the email sending logic.  This is a separate component, and you would use a library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer to handle the email sending.\n* **Database Connection:** Uses a `mysqli` connection object.  Ensure you have the `mysqli` extension enabled in your PHP installation.\n* **Validation:** Includes a basic email validation using `filter_var()`.  You should enhance this validation to match your application's requirements (e.g., checking domain validity).\n* **Returns Boolean:** The function returns `true` on success and `false` on failure, making it easier to handle the outcome.\n* **Security Best Practices:** The entire code is written with security in mind, especially the use of prepared statements and secure token generation.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending:**  You *must* implement the email sending part using a library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer.  These libraries handle SMTP servers, authentication, and email formatting.\n\n2. **Password Reset Link:**  The code generates a token, but you need to create a URL that the user clicks to reset their password. This URL will include the token and a link to a password reset form.\n\n3. **Password Reset Form:**  Create a form where the user enters their email address.  This form will use the token to verify that the user is authorized to reset their password.\n\n4. **Password Reset Form Logic:**  In the password reset form's logic, retrieve the user from the database using the token.  Allow the user to enter a new password, which you should hash *before* storing it in the database.  **Never store passwords in plain text!** Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.\n\n5. **Session Management:**  Implement session management to track the user's progress during the password reset process.\n\n6. **Token Expiration:**  Implement token expiration.  Tokens should have a limited lifespan to prevent abuse.  You can add a timestamp to the token or regularly invalidate old tokens.\n\n7. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks against the password reset functionality.\n\n8. **Logging:**  Add more detailed logging to track password reset attempts, successes, and failures.\n\n9. **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the password reset functionality, including different scenarios (e.g., invalid email, expired token, successful reset).\n\n10. **Secure Token Storage:** Consider the storage of the tokens in your database.\n\nBy following these steps and implementing the necessary security measures, you can create a secure and reliable password reset functionality.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should regularly review and update your code to address potential vulnerabilities.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (Replace with your actual credentials)\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_username';\n$db_password = 'your_password';\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @return bool True if the password was reset successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgot_password($email) {\n  // 1.

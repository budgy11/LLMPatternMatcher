This is *essential* for security. The `bin2hex()` function converts the binary data from `random_bytes()` into a hexadecimal string for storage and transmission.  Don't use `rand()` or `mt_rand()` for generating tokens - they are not secure enough.\n* **Input Validation:**  The code now *always* validates the email address:\n    * `filter_input(INPUT_POST, \"email\", FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL)`: This function from PHP's `filter` extension *sanitizes* the email input.  `FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL` removes invalid characters and ensures the input conforms to the email address format.  It's the *correct* way to handle user input in a web form.\n* **Clearer Database Simulation:** The example database interaction is now more explicit, clearly showing the simulation. The comments make it clear that in a real application, you would use a proper database query to create and manage the `reset_tokens` table.\n* **Expiry Time:**  The `expiry_time` field is included in the `reset_token` array.  This is *crucial* for security.  Tokens should expire after a certain period (e.g., 1 hour) to prevent attackers from using compromised tokens indefinitely.  The `time() + 3600` calculates the expiration time (1 hour from the current time).\n* **`$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']` for URL:** Uses `$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']` to generate the reset link URL.  This ensures the URL uses the correct protocol (http or https) based on the request.\n* **Complete HTML Form:**  The code includes a complete HTML form for the password reset process. This allows users to enter their email address and initiate the reset process.\n* **Error Handling:**  The example handles the case where the email format is invalid.\n* **Comments and Explanation:** The code is well-commented to explain the logic and the importance of each step.\n* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The `forgotPassword` function is responsible solely for generating the reset token and sending the email.\n* **`required` Attribute:** The HTML input field for the email address has the `required` attribute, which makes the field mandatory.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps (Beyond this Example)**\n\n1. **Database Integration:**\n   - Use a database library appropriate for your PHP version (e.g., PDO, MySQLi).\n   - Create a `reset_tokens` table in your database with the following columns: `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT), `email` (VARCHAR), `token` (VARCHAR), `expiry_time` (TIMESTAMP).\n\n2. **Password Reset Link Generation:**\n   - When a user clicks the reset link, you'll need to:\n      - Verify the token against the `reset_tokens` table.\n      - If the token is valid and not expired, you can proceed to allow the user to set a new password.\n\n3. **Password Reset Logic:**\n   - Implement the logic to allow the user to set a new password.  *Never* store the user's password directly in the database. Instead, store a hashed version of the password. Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  Limit the number of password reset requests that can be made from a single IP address within a given time period.\n\n5. **Security Best Practices:**\n   - **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n   - **Input Validation:**  Validate *all* user input to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.\n   - **Output Encoding:**  Encode output properly to prevent XSS attacks.\n   - **Logging:**  Log all password reset requests for auditing purposes.\n\n6. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch and handle any exceptions that may occur.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a robust and secure foundation for your password reset functionality.  Remember to adapt and enhance it based on your specific application requirements and security considerations.  *Always* prioritize security when dealing with user credentials.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// This example uses a simplified database for demonstration.  \n// In a real application, you'll likely use a proper database library and \n// sanitize and validate user input thoroughly.\n\n// Example database credentials (replace with your actual credentials)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_name = \"your_database_name\";\n$db_user = \"your_username\";\n$db_password = \"your_password\";\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @return string A message indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email): string\n{\n    // 1.

This makes brute-force attacks significantly harder.\n    * **`PDO::FETCH_ASSOC`:**  Using `PDO::FETCH_ASSOC` is the standard and recommended way to fetch an associative array from a database, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.\n    * **Prepared Statements:** Uses prepared statements with placeholders (`?`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is *essential* for any database interaction.  The `execute()` method properly escapes the user's email, preventing malicious code from being injected into your query.\n* **Error Handling/Validation:**\n    * **Checks if Email Exists:**  The code now explicitly checks if the user exists in the database *before* generating a token.  If the email doesn't exist, it returns an appropriate message.\n* **Clearer Function Design:**\n    * **`forgotPassword()`:**  This function handles the core logic:\n        * Checks for the user's existence.\n        * Generates the token.\n        * Inserts the token into the `password_resets` table.\n        * Calls the `sendResetPasswordEmail()` function.\n    * **`sendResetPasswordEmail()`:** This function is now a separate function, making the code more modular and easier to test and customize.  It's clearly marked as a placeholder that *you* need to implement with your email sending logic.\n* **Database Interaction:**\n    * **`password_resets` Table:** The code assumes you have a table named `password_resets` in your database with the following structure (at a minimum):\n      ```sql\n      CREATE TABLE password_resets (\n          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n          user_id INT NOT NULL,\n          token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n          created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n      );\n      ```\n* **Token Storage:** The `password_resets` table stores the token, the user's ID, and the timestamp when the token was created. This is crucial for security.  The token is deleted after the user successfully resets their password.\n* **Password Reset Link:** The `resetLink` is constructed dynamically and includes the token. *This is how the user accesses the reset form*.\n* **Placeholder Email Sending:** The `sendResetPasswordEmail()` function is a placeholder. *You must replace this with your actual email sending code*. The commented-out example shows how to use PHPMailer, a popular PHP library for sending emails.\n* **Clearer Comments:**  Improved comments throughout the code explain what's happening.\n* **Example Usage:** The code includes an example of how to call the `forgotPassword()` function.\n* **`TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`:**  This ensures that the `created_at` column is automatically populated with the current date and time when a new password reset token is created.\n* **Database Connection:** The code assumes that you've already established a database connection and assigned it to the `$db` variable. You'll need to modify the code to connect to your database.\n* **Token Expiration (Important):**  *This code does not include token expiration*.  In a production environment, you *must* add a mechanism to expire the tokens after a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  This prevents attackers from using expired tokens to reset passwords. You can add a `token_expires_at` column to the `password_resets` table and update it when the user resets their password.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Implement Email Sending:**  Replace the placeholder `sendResetPasswordEmail()` function with your chosen email sending logic (PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, or your own SMTP implementation).\n2. **Token Expiration:** Add token expiration to the `password_resets` table. This is absolutely critical for security.\n3. **Database Connection:**  Make sure you have a valid database connection set up.\n4. **Password Reset Form:** Create a form on your website where users can enter their email address to request a password reset.  This form should redirect to the `forgotPassword()` function.\n5. **Reset Password Form:** Create a form on your website where users can enter the token and their new password.  This form should:\n    * Validate the token (check if it exists in the `password_resets` table).\n    * Hash the new password using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).\n    * Update the user's password in the `users` table.\n    * Delete the corresponding token from the `password_resets` table.\n6. **Security Auditing:** Have your code reviewed by a security expert to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure, robust, and well-structured foundation for a password reset functionality in your PHP application. Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices.  Always keep your code updated with the latest security recommendations.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user requesting a password reset.\n * @return string  A message indicating success or failure.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email): string\n{\n    global $db;  // Assuming $db is your database connection object\n\n    // 1.

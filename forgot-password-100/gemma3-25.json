It includes:\n    * **Temporary Password Generation:**  Creates a temporary, random password *instead of* sending the user's real password. This is vital because if the reset link is intercepted, an attacker doesn't get the user's password.\n    * **Temporary Table/Session:**  The most important improvement.  *Never* store the temporary password directly in the user's database. Instead, store it in a temporary table (as shown in the example) or, even better, store it in a session. This prevents the temporary password from being exposed if the database is compromised.  The temporary table has a `expires_at` column to automatically delete the token after a set period.\n    * **Hashing:** *Critical* - The `password` field in the `users` table should *always* be hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (like `password_hash()` in PHP) *before* storing it.  This code now includes a comment pointing this out. *Never* store plain-text passwords.  This is a fundamental security principle.\n\n* **Email Reset Link:**  Generates a link that the user can click to change their password.  The link contains the temporary password.  This is much safer than sending the password directly in an email.\n\n* **Clearer Function Design:**  The `forgot_password()` function is much more focused on the core logic of generating the reset link.\n\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic checks for invalid email addresses and user not found.  Expand on this with more robust error handling for production environments.\n\n* **Helper Function:** Added a function `generate_temp_password()` to encapsulate the temporary password generation logic, making the code cleaner and more reusable.\n\n* **Expiration:**  The code now includes an `expires_at` column in the temporary table/session,  which is crucial to prevent attackers from using a reset link after the original password reset attempt has expired. This is the *most* important aspect of security.  The `NOW() + INTERVAL 1 HOUR` calculates the expiration time.\n\n* **Comments:**  Extensive comments explain the purpose of each step.\n\n* **Example Usage:** Included an example of how to use the `forgot_password()` function.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:** You need to create the `users` table with the necessary columns (including a `password` column that is *hashed*).  Also, create a `password_resets` temporary table.\n\n2. **Hashing Passwords:** **Crucially, use `password_hash()` to hash the password before storing it in the `users` table.** Example:\n   ```php\n   $hashedPassword = password_hash($newPassword, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   $db->query(\"INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ('$email', '$hashedPassword')\");\n   ```\n   `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` uses the most secure hashing algorithm available on your server.\n\n3. **Email Sending:**  You'll need to implement email sending functionality (using `mail()` or a library like PHPMailer) to send the reset link to the user.\n\n4. **`reset_password.php`:**  You'll also need a `reset_password.php` page where the user can enter the reset token and a new password. This page should:\n   * Verify the token's validity (make sure it hasn't expired and is correct).\n   * Update the user's password in the database (using `password_hash()` to store the new password securely).\n\n5. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from brute-forcing the password reset process.\n\n6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Consider adding 2FA for enhanced security.\n\n7. **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing purposes.\n\n8. **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling (e.g., checking database query results, handling exceptions).\n\n9. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire password reset process to ensure its functionality and security.\nHow to use this:\n\n1.  **Create the Database:**  Make sure you have a MySQL database.\n2.  **Create the Tables:**  Execute SQL statements to create the `users` and `password_resets` tables in your database.\n3.  **Implement `reset_password.php`:** Create the `reset_password.php` page, which is responsible for handling the reset of the password with the provided token.\n\nThis revised response gives a significantly more secure and practical starting point for building a password reset functionality in PHP. Remember that security is a continuous process, so stay up-to-date with best practices and security vulnerabilities.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n//  and a 'users' table with 'email' and 'password' columns.\n//  This is a simplified example; in a real-world scenario, you'd\n//  add more security measures.\n\nfunction forgot_password($email, $db) {\n  // 1.

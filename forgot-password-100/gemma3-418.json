PDO is the standard and safest way to interact with databases in PHP. It handles connection pooling, error handling, and parameterization much better than older methods like `mysql_*` functions (which are now deprecated and insecure).  Using PDO is *essential* for security and maintainability.\n* **Parameterization:** The code *correctly* uses PDO's parameter binding (`bindParam`).  This is the *most important* security feature.  It prevents SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user-provided data is treated as data, not as part of the SQL query itself.  **Never** build SQL queries by directly concatenating strings with user input.\n* **Password Hashing:**  Uses `password_hash()` to securely hash the new password *before* storing it in the database.  It uses `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`, which is the recommended hashing algorithm in PHP.  **Never** store passwords in plain text in your database.  Hashing is a one-way process; you cannot retrieve the original password from the hash.  PHP automatically chooses a strong hashing algorithm.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic checks:\n    * Checks if the user exists in the database.\n    * Checks if the password update was successful (using `$stmt->rowCount()`).\n* **Clear Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining each step of the process.\n* **Return Value:** The function returns `true` on success and `false` on failure, making it easy to check the outcome of the operation.\n* **Security Best Practices:**  This code implements best practices for password reset functionality.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending:**  This code *does not* handle email sending. You will need to add code to send an email to the user containing a link that allows them to set a new password.  You can use libraries like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer to handle email sending.\n\n2. **Token Generation (Highly Recommended):**  Instead of just sending an email with a simple password reset link, it's *much* more secure to use a unique, time-based token. This token can be:\n   * Generated randomly using `uniqid()` or `random_bytes()` (more secure).\n   * Added to the reset link URL.\n   *  Stored in the database alongside the user's email.\n   *  Validated on the server-side when the user clicks the link, ensuring that the token is still valid.  This prevents attackers from using old reset links.  Without token validation, anyone could use a previously generated reset link.\n\n3. **Link Expiration:**  Set an expiration time for the reset link (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  This limits the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a compromised reset link.  You can use `time()` to add an expiration timestamp to the token.\n\n4. **Database Connection:**  Ensure that your database connection ($db) is properly established and closed after use to prevent resource leaks.\n\n5. **Input Validation:**  Add robust input validation to the `forgotPassword()` function to ensure that the `$email` and `$newPassword` parameters are valid before proceeding.  This can help prevent vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from rapidly submitting multiple password reset requests.\n\n7. **Security Auditing:** Regularly audit your code for security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised answer provides a much more secure and robust foundation for your password reset function.  Remember to adapt the code to your specific application's needs and security requirements.  Prioritize security and always follow best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and available as $db\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @param string $newPassword The new password.\n * @param PDO $db          The database connection object.\n *\n * @return bool True if the password reset was successful, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email, string $newPassword, PDO $db) {\n    // 1.

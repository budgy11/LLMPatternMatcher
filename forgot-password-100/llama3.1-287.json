{"prompt": "Create a forgot password function using php", "llm_output": "Here is an example of how to create a forgot password function in PHP:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the database**\n\nFirst, you need to set up your database with a table for users. Create a new table called `users` with the following columns:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL\n);\n```\n**Step 2: Create the forgot password form**\n\nCreate a new PHP file (e.g. `forgot-password.php`) with the following code:\n```php\n<?php\n\n// Connect to database\n$conn = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n?>\n\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n    <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"><br><br>\n    <button type=\"submit\" name=\"forgot-password\">Forgot Password</button>\n</form>\n\n<?php\nif (isset($_POST['forgot-password'])) {\n    // Check if email is valid\n    $email = $_POST['email'];\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='$email'\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n    \n    if ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        // Generate a new password and send it to the user's email\n        $newPassword = substr(md5(uniqid()), 0, 8);\n        $to      = $email;\n        $subject = 'Your new password';\n        $message = 'Dear user, your new password is: '.$newPassword;\n        mail($to, $subject, $message);\n\n        // Update the user's password in the database\n        $query = \"UPDATE users SET password='$newPassword' WHERE email='$email'\";\n        mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n        \n        echo 'Your new password has been sent to your email. Please check your email for more information.';\n    } else {\n        echo 'Email not found. Please try again.';\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\nThis code creates a form with an input field for the user's email and a submit button labeled \"Forgot Password\". When the form is submitted, it checks if the email exists in the database and generates a new password using MD5 and Uniqid functions.\n\n**Step 3: Send the new password via email**\n\nIf the email is valid, it sends an email to the user with their new password. You can use any mail library or function you like (e.g. PHPMailer, SwiftMailer).\n\nNote: This code does not store the new password in the database, but instead updates the existing password. Also, this code uses MD5 for generating a new password which is not recommended as it is insecure. Consider using more secure methods such as hash_hmac.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\nWhen a user clicks on the \"Forgot Password\" link and submits their email address, they will receive an email with their new password. They can then log in to the system using their email and the new password.\n\nNote: This is a basic example of how to create a forgot password function using PHP. You should consider implementing additional security measures such as:\n\n* Verifying the user's email before sending them their new password.\n* Using a more secure method for generating new passwords (e.g. hash_hmac).\n* Storing additional information about the user in the database (e.g. reset token).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!", "code_blocks": [null, "```php\n<?php\n\n// Connect to database\n$conn = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n?>\n\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n    <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"><br><br>\n    <button type=\"submit\" name=\"forgot-password\">Forgot Password</button>\n</form>\n\n<?php\nif (isset($_POST['forgot-password'])) {\n    // Check if email is valid\n    $email = $_POST['email'];\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='$email'\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n    \n    if ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        // Generate a new password and send it to the user's email\n        $newPassword = substr(md5(uniqid()), 0, 8);\n        $to      = $email;\n        $subject = 'Your new password';\n        $message = 'Dear user, your new password is: '.$newPassword;\n        mail($to, $subject, $message);\n\n        // Update the user's password in the database\n        $query = \"UPDATE users SET password='$newPassword' WHERE email='$email'\";\n        mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n        \n        echo 'Your new password has been sent to your email.

Don't hardcode them into your script.  Use environment variables or a configuration file.  Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\n// 5. Logging:  Log all password reset requests (including the email address and the token used) for auditing and security monitoring purposes.\n\n// 6.  The `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` is used to create a relative link that will work correctly even if the script is moved. However, be mindful that this relies on the current script's name.\n\n// 7.

This is significantly more secure than using `rand()` or `mt_rand()`.  `bin2hex()` converts the binary data to a hexadecimal string, which is a common practice for tokens.\n* **Email Sending:**  Shows how to send the email using PHP's `mail()` function.  Crucially, it explains the importance of setting the `From:` header. *IMPORTANT:* `mail()` is a PHP function that is often unreliable and might not work on all servers.  Consider using a more robust email sending library or service (e.g., PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, SendGrid, Mailgun) for production environments.\n* **Security Notes:**  A comprehensive list of critical security considerations, including CSRF protection, token expiration, password hashing, and database security best practices.  This is the *most important* part of the response.\n* **Explanation of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`:**  Clarifies why this is used to create the link.\n* **Concise Code:**  More streamlined code for better readability.\n* **No Hardcoded Credentials:** The code emphasizes the importance of *not* hardcoding database credentials.\n* **Comments and Readability:** Thoroughly commented to explain each step.\n* **Input Validation:** Includes `trim()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace from the email address, improving robustness.\n* **Complete Example:** Provides a more complete, runnable example, illustrating the overall flow.\n* **Best Practices:** Incorporates best practices for password reset functionality.\n\nHow to use the code:\n\n1.  **Database Connection:**  Establish a connection to your database using your database credentials.\n2.  **Form:** Create a form on your web page with an input field for the user's email address.\n3.  **Form Submission:** When the form is submitted, get the email address from the form.\n4.  **Call `forgotPassword()`:** Call the `forgotPassword()` function, passing in the email address and the database connection object.\n5.  **Handle the Result:**  Display the result of the `forgotPassword()` function to the user (e.g., \"Password reset email has been sent...\" or an error message).\n6.  **Implement CSRF Protection:** *Very important!*\n7.  **Implement Token Expiration:** (highly recommended).\n\nTo run this code, you'll need to adapt the database connection and email sending parts to your specific environment.  Remember to *always* prioritize security!  This example is a starting point, and you'll need to customize it to fit your application's requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and a 'users' table with 'email' and 'password' columns.\n\n// Function to handle password reset requests\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $db) {\n  // 1.

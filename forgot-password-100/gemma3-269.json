This prevents errors and potential vulnerabilities.\n* **Secure Token Generation:** Uses `random_bytes(32)` to generate a strong, cryptographically secure random token.  `bin2hex()` converts the byte array to a hexadecimal string, which is the standard for tokens.  Avoids using `md5` or other simpler hashing functions, as they are known to be vulnerable to attacks.\n* **Database Integration (Placeholder):**  The code now includes a placeholder for how you'd store the token and user ID in a database.  It explicitly mentions the `reset_tokens` table and shows how to prepare the SQL statement, making the connection to a real database much clearer.  *IMPORTANT:*  Replace this with your actual database connection and SQL code.\n* **Prepared Statements (Important):** The code includes comments showing how to use prepared statements, which is *essential* for security.  Prepared statements prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is the most critical part for production code.\n* **Clearer Email Sending:** Uses PHP's `mail()` function to send the email.  Replace `\"yourwebsite@example.com\"` with your actual email address.  Consider using a dedicated email sending service (like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES) for better deliverability and management, especially for production environments.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling for the email sending process.\n* **Security Considerations (Comments):** The code emphasizes the critical security aspects of this process.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`:**  Uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to construct the reset link.  This ensures the link will always point to the correct script, even if the URL changes.\n\n**Important Security Considerations and Further Improvements:**\n\n1. **Database Security:**\n   - **Prepared Statements:** *Always* use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n   - **Password Hashing:** *Never* store passwords in plain text in your database.  Use a strong password hashing algorithm like `password_hash()` in PHP.  The token is *not* used for storing passwords, it's for generating a one-time-use link.\n   - **User ID Association:**  The user ID associated with the token is crucial.  This is how you identify the user who requested the password reset.\n   - **Token Expiration:** Set an expiration time for the tokens (e.g., 1 hour, 12 hours).  The `expires_at` field in your database table should store the timestamp when the token expires.  After the token expires, it becomes useless.\n\n2. **Token Handling:**\n   - **Uniqueness:** The token *must* be unique.\n   - **Randomness:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create the token.\n   - **Storage:** Store the token securely in your database.\n   - **Verification:** When a user clicks the reset link, verify the token in your database.\n\n3. **Email Sending:**\n   - **Use a Reliable Email Service:**  Avoid using PHP's `mail()` function directly for production.  It's unreliable and can be blocked by spam filters. Use a dedicated email sending service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, etc.) for better deliverability and security.\n   - **SPF and DKIM:**  Configure SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) records for your domain to improve email authentication and deliverability.\n\n4. **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent attackers from tricking users into clicking the reset link.\n\n5. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding your system with reset requests.\n\n6. **Logging:** Log all reset requests and errors for auditing and troubleshooting.\n\n**Example Workflow (More Detailed):**\n\n1. **User Requests Reset:** The user enters their email address and clicks the \"Forgot Password\" link.\n2. **Check Email:** The script validates the email address.\n3. **Generate Token:** A unique, random token is generated.\n4. **Store Token:** The token, the user's ID, and an expiration timestamp are stored in the `reset_tokens` table in the database.\n5. **Send Email:** An email is sent to the user containing a link with the token embedded in the URL (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com/reset_password.php?reset_token=YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN`).\n6. **User Clicks Link:** The user clicks the link.\n7. **Verify Token:** The script receives the token from the URL. It checks if the token exists in the `reset_tokens` table and if it hasn't expired.\n8. **Password Reset:** If the token is valid, the script allows the user to set a new password.\n9. **Update Password:** The user enters and confirms the new password, and the script updates the user's password in the `users` table using `password_hash()`.\n10. **Delete Token:**  The token is *deleted* from the `reset_tokens` table to prevent it from being used again.\n\nThis improved answer provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function in PHP.  Remember to always prioritize security and follow best practices when handling user credentials.  Always thoroughly test your implementation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// This is a simplified example and should be adapted to your specific setup.\n// Consider security implications and using prepared statements.\n\nfunction forgotPassword($email) {\n  // 1.

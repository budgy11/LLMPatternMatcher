The code comments strongly advise using a strong hashing algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2) to hash the token before storing it in the database. This prevents attackers from easily stealing and using the tokens.\n    * **Token Expiry:**  The code now *mentions* the necessity of token expiry.  This is crucial.\n    * **Rate Limiting:**  The comments remind you about the importance of rate limiting.\n    * **Input Validation:** Emphasis on thorough input validation and sanitization.\n* **Database Interaction:**\n    * **Prepared Statements (Commented Out):**  The code shows how prepared statements *should* be used.  Although this example uses a simple query for demonstration, the comments make it clear that you must use them in a real-world application.\n    * **Error Handling:** Includes a basic `error_log()` call for database errors, which is a *minimum* level of error handling.\n* **Email Sending:**\n    * **`mail()` Function Warning:**  The code now *strongly* warns against using PHP's `mail()` function, which is notoriously unreliable.  It advises using a dedicated email sending service.\n* **Clearer Comments and Explanation:** The comments are much more detailed and explain *why* certain things are done.\n* **Error Logging:** Includes `error_log()` calls for both database and email sending errors. This is essential for debugging.\n* **Example Usage:** The example usage is marked clearly as *testing code* and should *not* be used directly in a production environment.\n* **Important Considerations Section:** A dedicated section highlighting all the essential aspects of a robust password reset implementation.\n* **Code Structure:** Improved code organization and readability.\n\nThis revised answer provides a significantly more secure and practical starting point for implementing a password reset function in PHP.  Remember to adapt this code to your specific database schema and application requirements.  And *always* prioritize security!  This response is designed to guide you to a secure and robust implementation.  It's not a complete, ready-to-deploy solution, but it provides a solid foundation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @return bool True if the password reset email was sent successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email)\n{\n  // Validate the email address\n  if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n    error_log(\"Invalid email address provided.\"); // Log the error for debugging\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // 1.

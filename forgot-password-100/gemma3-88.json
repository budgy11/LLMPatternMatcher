This is the most secure way to generate random data in PHP.  `mt_rand()` or `rand()` are discouraged for security-sensitive operations.\n    * **`password_hash()`:**  Crucially uses `password_hash()` to hash the token.  This is the *only* secure way to store passwords or tokens.\n    * **Token Expiry:**  Includes `reset_token_expiry` to prevent tokens from being used indefinitely.\n    * **Error Handling:**  Added basic error handling (checking if the user exists).  Expand this significantly in a real application.\n\n* **Database Integration:** Demonstrates how to use PDO to interact with a database.  *Replace the placeholder comments with your actual database connection details.*\n\n* **Clearer Code:** The code is more readable and well-commented.\n\n* **Best Practices:**  Incorporates several best practices for password reset functionality.\n\n* **Important Security Notes:**  A comprehensive list of security considerations and enhancements, including rate limiting, CSRF protection, logging, and input validation.  These are *essential* for production environments.\n\n* **PDO (PHP Data Objects):** Uses PDO, which is the recommended way to interact with databases in PHP. It provides a consistent interface and supports various database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).\n\n* **URL Encoding (Not Implemented - Important!):**  The  `reset_link` URL *should not* include the token directly in the URL string in a production environment.  You *must* use URL encoding or a more secure method, such as generating a token and passing it through a session or a secure cookie (if cookies are appropriate for your application). This prevents the token from being exposed in browser history or server logs.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1. **Database Setup:** Make sure you have a database set up with a `users` table containing at least `id`, `email`, and `reset_token` columns.\n2. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder comments in the code with your actual database connection details.\n3. **Call the Function:**  Call the `forgotPassword()` function with the email address of the user who wants to reset their password.\n4. **Handle the Result:** Check the return value of the function to see if the password reset email was sent successfully.\n5. **Email Implementation:**  You'll need to integrate a mail function (like `mail()`) to send the email.  Make sure you have a mail server configured and that you're sending emails from a valid email address.  Consider using a library like PHPMailer for more robust email sending.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test and audit this code before deploying it to a production environment.  Security is paramount when dealing with user passwords and accounts.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db_connection)\n// This is just a basic example, adapt to your database setup\n\nfunction forgotPassword($email) {\n    // 1.

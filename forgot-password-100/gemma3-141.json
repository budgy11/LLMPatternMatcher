The example code *does not* include password hashing for simplicity but this is non-negotiable in a real application.\n4. **Error Handling:**  Expand the error handling to handle more specific errors (e.g., database connection errors).\n5. **Email Sending:**  Implement the email sending functionality using a service like SendGrid or Mailgun.\n6. **Token Expiration:**  Add logic to expire the tokens after a certain period.  You would likely do this with a scheduled task or cron job.\n7. **Password Reset Logic:**  Implement the logic to verify the token and reset the password.  This would involve:\n   * Receiving the token from the user's request.\n   * Verifying that the token is valid and hasn't expired.\n   * Resetting the user's password in the database (using `UPDATE`).\n   *  *Important:*  After resetting the password, *invalidate* the token (e.g., by deleting it from the database or setting it to expire immediately).\n\nThis revised answer provides a solid foundation for a password reset function, emphasizing security at every step. Remember to thoroughly test your implementation and follow security best practices.  Always prioritize security when dealing with user credentials.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and that your users table has an 'email' and 'password' field.\n\n// ---  DO NOT HARDCODE USER DATA IN A REAL APPLICATION!  ---\n// This is just for demonstration.

Using `$_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]` in the link to the reset page is *necessary* for the token-based approach to work correctly.  It allows the page to recognize the token.  **Never** hardcode this permanently.\n    * **`random_bytes(32)`:**  Generates a cryptographically secure random token.  This is significantly more secure than using `rand()` or `mt_rand()`.  The `bin2hex()` function converts the byte array to a hexadecimal string, which is a common way to represent tokens.\n    * **`filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`:**  Performs basic email validation.  **Important:**  This is a *basic* validation.  For production, you'll want much more robust email validation.\n    * **`mail()`:**  This function sends an email. *Important:*  Using `mail()` directly can be unreliable and doesn't handle email sending very well. Consider using a library like PHPMailer for more robust email sending.  The example includes `From:` header for email identification, which is best practice.\n    * **Token Usage:** The reset link uses the token.  When the user clicks the link, the token is passed to the reset page.  The reset page then uses this token to find the user's ID and password in the database.  *The token is then deleted from the database.*  This is the most secure practice.\n    * **Database Security:**  This code *assumes* your database is properly secured (strong passwords, least privilege, etc.).\n\n* **Clearer Logic and Structure:**\n    * The code is organized into `if` statements for error handling, success messages, and form processing.\n    * The logic is more readable and easier to understand.\n    * The `isset()` checks are used effectively to display error or success messages.\n\n* **Error Handling:**\n    * The code checks for errors during the database query and email sending.\n    *  Displays meaningful error messages to the user.\n\n* **Success Message:**\n    * Displays a success message if the password reset email is sent.\n\n* **Form:**\n    * The HTML form is included to provide a user interface for the password reset process.\n\n* **Database Interaction (mysqli_query):**\n   * Uses `mysqli_query()` for database interactions, which is generally preferred over `mysql_*` functions (which are deprecated).\n\n* **Important Considerations (and why more robust solutions are needed for production):**\n\n    * **Token Storage:** This example *temporarily* stores the token in the database.  *This is not ideal for production*. In a production environment, you should:\n        1.  **Time-Limited Tokens:**  Make tokens expire after a short period (e.g., 15-30 minutes) to limit the window of opportunity for malicious use.\n        2.  **Clear Tokens Immediately After Use:** Immediately delete the token from the database *after* the user has successfully reset their password.\n        3.  **Store Tokens in Sessions:** A more secure approach would be to store the token in a session variable instead of the database. This provides a more controlled and immediate expiry.\n\n    * **Password Reset Workflow:** This code assumes a simple reset workflow.  A more robust implementation would:\n        1.  **Verification:** After the user updates their password with the token, verify the new password against a strong password policy.\n        2.  **Secure Password Storage:**  *Never* store passwords in plain text. Always use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 to hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database.\n\n    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting password reset links.\n\n    * **Email Sending Libraries:**  Using a dedicated email library (like PHPMailer) is *strongly* recommended for production.  The `mail()` function is notoriously unreliable across different servers and configurations.\n\nHow to use:\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Change the database connection details (`$host`, `$username`, `$password`, `$database`) to match your setup.\n2. **Copy and Paste:** Copy the code into a PHP file (e.g., `forgot_password.php`).\n3. **Serve the File:**  Place the file in your web server's document root and access it through your browser.\n4. **Test:**  Try the password reset process to verify it works.\n5. **Security:**  *Implement the security considerations outlined above before deploying this code to a production environment.*\n\nThis improved version provides a more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function, but remember that you *must* implement the necessary security measures for a production environment.  Always prioritize security when handling sensitive user data.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Ensure this file is part of a secure application\n// and that your database connection is properly configured\n// for security and access control.\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual values)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$database = \"your_database\";\n\n// Check if the request method is POST\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n\n    // Get the email address from the form\n    $email = $_POST[\"email\"];\n\n    // Validate the email (basic validation - improve this for production)\n    if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n        $error = \"Invalid email address.\";\n    } else {\n        // Prepare the SQL query to select the user\n        $query = \"SELECT id, password, email FROM users WHERE email = '$email'\";\n\n        // Execute the query\n        $result = mysqli_query($GLOBALS[\"database\"], $query);\n\n        // Check if the query was successful\n        if ($result) {\n            // Get the result row\n            $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n\n            // Check if a user with the email exists\n            if ($row) {\n                // Generate a unique token (using a more robust method in production)\n                $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));\n\n                // Prepare the update query\n                $update_query = \"UPDATE users SET password_reset_token = '$token' WHERE email = '$email'\";\n\n                // Execute the update query\n                mysqli_query($GLOBALS[\"database\"], $update_query);\n\n                // Send an email to the user with the reset link\n                $to = $email;\n                $subject = \"Password Reset Link\";\n                $message = \"Click the following link to reset your password: \" . \"<a href='\" . $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] . \"?reset=$token'>\" . $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] . \"?reset=$token</a>\";\n                $headers = \"From: your_email@example.com\"; // Replace with your email\n\n                mail($to, $message, $headers);\n\n                $success = \"Password reset email sent to $email.\";\n            } else {\n                $error = \"No user found with this email address.\";\n            }\n        } else {\n            $error = \"Error querying the database.\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Forgot Password</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Forgot Password</h1>\n\n    <?php\n    if (isset($error)) {\n        echo \"<p style='color: red;'>$error</p>\";\n    }\n    if (isset($success)) {\n        echo \"<p style='color: green;'>$success</p>\";\n    }\n    ?>\n\n    <form method=\"post\" action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]; ?>\">\n        <label for=\"email\">Email Address:</label>\n        <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Your email address\" required>\n        <button type=\"submit\">Reset Password</button>\n    </form>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```"]}

This is critical for security.\n* **Prepared Statements (Not Directly Implemented - See Note Below):** While a full prepared statement would be ideal, this example avoids it for simplicity.  A *real* application *should* use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  The use of `$conn->query()` directly is vulnerable to SQL injection if `$email` or `$newPassword` come from user input without proper sanitization.  See the notes below on how to implement prepared statements.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling to check for database connection errors and query execution errors.  This provides helpful information if something goes wrong.  More robust error handling (logging, more informative messages) is recommended for production applications.\n* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$hashedPassword`) for better readability.\n* **Connection Closing:**  Ensures that the database connection is closed using `$conn->close()` after the query is executed. This releases resources and prevents potential issues.\n* **Simulated Example Usage:**  The example usage part is clearly marked as a demonstration and shouldn't be exposed directly in a public-facing application.  It makes it easy to test the function without needing a real form.\n* **Comments and Explanations:** Comprehensive comments explain each step of the process.\n\n**How to Implement Prepared Statements (Important Security Consideration)**\n\nTo prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, you *must* use prepared statements.  Here's how you'd modify the code to do that:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// ... (Database connection details - same as before)\n\n// Function to reset password (using prepared statement)\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $newPassword) {\n  // 1. Connect to the database\n  $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n  // Check connection\n  if ($conn->connect_error) {\n    return \"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error;\n  }\n\n  // 2. Prepare the SQL statement\n  $sql = \"UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE email = ?\";  // Use placeholders instead of direct variable substitution\n  $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n\n  // 3. Bind the parameters\n  $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $newPassword, $email);  // 's' indicates a string\n\n  // 4. Execute the statement\n  if ($stmt->execute()) {\n    return \"Password reset successful. Please check your email for further instructions.\";\n  } else {\n    return \"Error resetting password: \" . $conn->error;\n  }\n\n  // 5. Close the connection\n  $conn->close();\n\n  // 6. Close the statement\n  $stmt->close();\n}\n```\n\nKey changes for prepared statements:\n\n* **Placeholders:**  The SQL query now uses placeholders (`?`) instead of direct variable substitution (`$email` and `$newPassword`).\n* **`$conn->prepare()`:** The `prepare()` method prepares the SQL statement for execution.\n* **`$stmt->bind_param()`:** The `bind_param()` method binds the values to the placeholders.  The first argument is the data type (e.g., \"s\" for string, \"i\" for integer).\n* **`$stmt->execute()`:** The `execute()` method executes the prepared statement with the bound values.\n* **`$stmt->close()`**: Closes the statement to release resources.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Email Sending:** This code *only* resets the password. It does *not* send an email to notify the user. You'll need to add code to send an email with instructions. Use a reliable email sending library or service.\n* **User Verification:**  It's highly recommended to add a verification step to the password reset process. For example:\n    *  After the password is reset, send an email with a link that the user must click to confirm the new password.  This helps prevent unauthorized password resets.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly trying to reset passwords.\n* **Logging:**  Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n* **Password Complexity:** Enforce password complexity rules (minimum length, special characters, etc.) to increase security.\n* **Database Security:**  Regularly update your database server and follow best practices for database security.\n\nThis revised answer provides a more secure and robust implementation of a password reset function. Remember to thoroughly test it and implement additional security measures as needed for your application.  Always prioritize security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual details)\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'your_username';\n$password = 'your_password';\n$database = 'your_database';\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $newPassword) {\n  // 1.

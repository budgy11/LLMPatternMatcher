It explicitly warns against storing plain text tokens in the database and emphasizes hashing passwords. This is *critical* for production code.\n* **Prepared Statements (Important Note):**  The code now strongly emphasizes the need for prepared statements when interacting with the database.  Using prepared statements protects against SQL injection, a major vulnerability.  You would use these with your database library (e.g., `mysqli`, `PDO`). I've provided comments showing where you would insert the code.\n* **Token Validation:** The `if ($token !== 'YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN')` line is a placeholder.  *Never* store plain text tokens. You *must* hash the token and store the hash in the database.  Then, you compare the hashed token to the hashed token from the database.\n* **Hashing Passwords:** The example includes a comment about hashing the new password.  *Always* hash passwords before storing them in the database.  Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.\n* **Clearer Structure and Comments:** The code is organized into numbered steps for better clarity.  The comments explain each step and highlight important considerations.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic checks for empty email or token and user not found. More sophisticated error handling would be appropriate for a real application.\n* **Example Usage:** Includes an example of how to call the `forgot_password` function.\n* **Database Interaction Placeholder:**  The code includes placeholder comments for the database query where you'd retrieve user data.  It also shows where to update the database.\n* **Emphasis on Secure Token Handling:** Repeatedly stresses that plain text tokens are extremely dangerous and must be hashed.\n\n**Important Considerations for Production Code:**\n\n1. **Database Library:** Use a robust database library like `mysqli` or PDO.  PDO is generally preferred as it offers better portability.\n\n2. **Prepared Statements:**  *Always* use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This is the most important security step.\n\n3. **Password Hashing:** Use a strong password hashing algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2) to hash passwords before storing them.\n\n4. **Token Generation:** Generate secure, random tokens using a cryptographically secure random number generator.\n\n5. **Token Expiration:** Set an expiration time for tokens. This limits the window of opportunity for attackers to use a compromised token.\n\n6. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint.\n\n7. **Email Sending:**  Use a reliable email sending service to send password reset emails.  Don't implement your own email sending logic, as it's complex and prone to errors.\n\n8. **Logging and Monitoring:**  Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n\n9. **Testing:** Thoroughly test your password reset functionality, including testing for security vulnerabilities.\nHow to use prepared statements (example using PDO):\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you've established a PDO connection called $pdo\n\nfunction forgot_password($email, $token) {\n  $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email\");\n  $stmt->bindParam(':email', $email, PDO::PARAM_STR);\n  $stmt->execute();\n\n  $user = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n  if ($user === null) {\n    return \"User not found.\";\n  }\n\n  // ... (Rest of the forgot_password function as before) ...\n}\n```\n\nThis example shows how to use PDO's prepared statement functionality to safely retrieve the user information from the database. `bindParam()` ensures the email value is properly escaped.\nThis revised response gives a much more comprehensive and secure foundation for a password reset functionality.  Remember to prioritize security best practices in your actual implementation. Remember to replace the placeholder code with your actual database connection and logic.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and a user table\n// with an 'email' field.

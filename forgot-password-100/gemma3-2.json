The `expiration = NOW()` sets the expiration time.\n\n// 3. **Token Uniqueness:** Ensure the generated tokens are truly unique. `random_bytes(32)` provides a high degree of uniqueness.\n\n// 4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint.  Limit the number of reset requests from the same IP address within a given time frame.\n\n// 5. **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Always validate and sanitize user input (email address, etc.) to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.\n\n// 6. **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n\n// 7. **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling and logging to help you debug issues and identify potential security breaches.  Don't display detailed error messages to the user in a production environment.\n\n// 8. **Email Sending Implementation:**  The `mail()` function is often unreliable across different servers and configurations. Consider using a dedicated email library or service (e.g., PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, SendGrid, Mailgun) for more reliable email sending.\n\n// 9. **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\n?>\n```\n\nKey improvements and explanations in this code:\n\n* **Token Expiration:** The `expiration = NOW()` part is crucial. It sets the expiration time of the token to the current time.  This prevents tokens from being used indefinitely.\n* **Unique Tokens:**  `random_bytes(32)` generates a cryptographically secure random string of 32 bytes, making token uniqueness highly likely.\n* **Database Interactions:**  The code uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. *Always* use prepared statements when handling user input in SQL queries.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error logging (`error_log()`) to help with debugging.  (In a production environment, you'd want more sophisticated logging and error handling).\n* **Clearer Structure and Comments:**  The code is formatted for readability with detailed comments explaining each step.\n* **Security Considerations:**  A comprehensive list of critical security considerations and improvements is provided as a comment block.  This is extremely important for production systems.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Using prepared statements is *essential* for security.\n* **Email Sending (Placeholder):** The email sending part is a placeholder. The code highlights that you'll need to use a proper email sending method, emphasizing the use of a library like PHPMailer or a dedicated email service.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  You'll need to create the necessary tables in your database (`users` and `reset_tokens`).  Ensure you have the columns defined correctly (email, password, token, expiration).\n2. **Connection:**  Replace the placeholder `$db` with your actual database connection.\n3. **Email Sending:** Implement a reliable email sending method.\n4. **URL:**  Adapt the `reset_url` to your website's URL structure.\n5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the function to ensure it works correctly.\n\nThis improved version addresses the most critical aspects of a password reset function, emphasizing security and best practices.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, so regularly review and update your code and security measures.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established\n// (e.g., $db = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");)\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgot_password($email) {\n    // 1.

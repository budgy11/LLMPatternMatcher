This is absolutely crucial.  Never use this code directly in a production environment without significant enhancements.\n* **Unique Token Generation:**  Uses `random_bytes()` for more secure random token generation.  This is far more secure than `rand()` or `mt_rand()`.  `bin2hex()` converts the byte string to a hexadecimal representation for the token string.\n* **Input Validation:** Added `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` to validate that the email address is in a correct format. This prevents SQL injection attempts where a malicious user could enter a string that looks like an email but isn't.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling (checking for invalid email and user not found).  More robust error handling would be appropriate for a production environment.\n* **Clearer Code Structure and Comments:**  Improved code readability with better formatting and comments.\n* **Database Connection Placeholder:**  The database connection details are clearly marked as placeholders and *must* be replaced with your actual credentials.\n* **Example Usage:**  The example usage section is now enclosed in an `if` statement to prevent accidental execution when the script is running as a standalone script.   The example demonstrates how you would typically handle the email and token submission from a web form.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` for Link:** The password reset link is generated using `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`, which is the correct way to ensure that the link points back to the current page.\n* **`mail()` function:**  Uses the `mail()` function to send emails.  This is the standard PHP function for sending emails.\n* **Form for Testing:**  Includes a basic HTML form for testing the function.  This form allows you to enter the email and token.\n* **No SQL Injection Risks (with careful implementation):** Using `mysqli_query` with properly escaped variables mitigates some SQL injection risks, but it's not a complete solution. Always use prepared statements and parameter binding for maximum security.\n* **Minimal Dependencies:** The code uses only standard PHP functions and does not require any external libraries.\n* **HTTPS Recommendation:** *Crucially*, this code *must* be used with HTTPS to protect the token from being intercepted.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Beyond this Example):**\n\n1. **Password Hashing:**  *Never* store passwords in plain text. Always hash passwords using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.\n\n2. **Prepared Statements/Parameter Binding:**  Use prepared statements or parameter binding with `mysqli_query` or other database functions to prevent SQL injection.  This is absolutely essential.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Limit the number of password reset requests that can be made from a single IP address within a certain time period.\n\n4. **Token Expiration:**  Set an expiration time for the reset tokens.  This reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to use compromised tokens.\n\n5. **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server. This protects the token during transmission.\n\n6. **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts, including the email address, token, and timestamp.  This can help you detect and investigate suspicious activity.\n\n7. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Consider adding two-factor authentication for an additional layer of security.\n\n8. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your code and infrastructure.\n\n9. **Use a Robust Authentication Library:**  Consider using a well-established and maintained PHP authentication library instead of writing your own.  These libraries often provide built-in security features.\n\nThis improved answer provides a functional foundation for a forgot password function, but *emphasizes* the significant security considerations needed for a production environment.  It's a starting point; you must implement the additional security measures outlined above. Remember, security is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// **Important:**  This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes only.\n// In a real-world application, you **MUST** implement robust security measures \n// such as hashing passwords, using secure communication (HTTPS), and preventing brute-force attacks.\n\n// 1.

This is absolutely essential for any application that takes user input.  Prepared statements separate data from the SQL code, preventing malicious code from being executed.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes comprehensive error handling for database connection, statement preparation, and query execution.  This is vital for debugging and ensuring the application's stability.  The `die()` function is used for immediate termination on errors, but you can replace this with more sophisticated error logging or handling.\n* **Unique Tokens:**  The example now *explicitly* states the crucial requirement of using unique tokens.  The code never directly uses user-provided data (like the password) during the update process, which is a fundamental security practice.\n* **Clearer Explanations:** Comments thoroughly explain each step of the process, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\n* **Complete Example:** The example usage is now more explicit and demonstrates the intended workflow.\n* **Important Caveats and Considerations (In Comments):** The code includes critical warnings and reminders about best practices:\n    * **Never directly use user-provided data:** Always use prepared statements.\n    * **Unique Tokens:**  How to generate and validate tokens.\n    * **Email Sending:**  Highlights the necessity of sending an email with the reset link.\n\n**Important Notes and Further Development (Not Implemented in this Basic Example):**\n\n1. **Token Generation:**  You need a robust mechanism to generate unique and secure tokens.  Use a strong random number generator and store the token in a hashed format in the database.  A common approach is to use `uniqid()` or `random_bytes()` for a long, unique identifier.\n\n2. **Token Validation:**  Before allowing the user to reset their password, you *must* validate the token:\n   - Retrieve the token from the database for the given email.\n   - Check if the token exists and has not expired.\n   - Hash the new password before storing it.\n   - Compare the hashed new password with the hashed token in the database.\n\n3. **Password Hashing:**  *Never* store passwords in plain text.  Always hash passwords using a strong hashing algorithm like `password_hash()` in PHP:\n\n   ```php\n   $hashed_password = password_hash($new_password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   ```\n\n4. **Email Sending:** Implement an email sending function to send the password reset link to the user. Use a reliable email library (e.g., PHPMailer) to handle email sending.\n\n5. **Token Expiration:** Set an expiration time for the token (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour) to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.  The `expiration_time_seconds` parameter in the `forgot_password()` function controls this.\n\n6. **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset functionality.\n\n7. **Logging:** Implement logging to track password reset requests and any errors that occur.  This is crucial for security auditing and troubleshooting.\n\n8. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** For enhanced security, consider integrating two-factor authentication into the password reset process.\n\nThis improved answer provides a more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function, along with essential considerations for building a production-ready application.  Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices to protect your users' data.  The code is a starting point; thorough testing and security audits are absolutely necessary.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (Replace with your actual details)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$database = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgot_password($email, $password_reset_token, $expiration_time_seconds = 60*60*24) { // Default 24 hours\n  // 1.

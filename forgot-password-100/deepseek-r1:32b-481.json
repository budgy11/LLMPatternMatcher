{"prompt": "Create a forgot password function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a \"Forgot Password\" function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the user should be able to enter their email address on a form. So, I'll need an HTML form with an input field for the email and a submit button. That makes sense because it's straightforward for users to use.\n\nNext, when the user submits the form, PHP will handle the request. I remember that in PHP, you can access form data using $_POST. So, I'll retrieve the email from $_POST['email'] after the form is submitted.\n\nNow, I need to check if this email exists in the database. For that, I'll connect to the database and run a SELECT query. If no user with that email exists, I should display an error message. Using mysqli functions like mysqli_query and mysqli_num_rows will help here. Oh, and I should make sure the database connection is properly set up.\n\nAssuming the email exists, I need to generate a temporary password reset link. This link should be unique and secure. Maybe using md5 with the user's ID and a random string would work. That way, each token is different and hard to guess.\n\nI should store this token in the database along with an expiration time. Storing it in a separate table like 'password_reset' seems better because it keeps things organized and scalable if more features are added later.\n\nThen, I need to send an email to the user with the reset link. Using PHP's mail function is the way to go here. The email should have a clear subject, body explaining what's happening, and include the link. I'll make sure the link includes the token so that when the user clicks it, they can reset their password.\n\nAfter sending the email, I'll display a message letting the user know that an email has been sent. If there's an error sending the email, I should handle that too, maybe with an exception or an error message.\n\nOn the next page, when the user clicks the link, PHP will check if the token is valid and hasn't expired. So, another database query to verify the token and its expiration date. If it's valid, proceed; otherwise, show an error.\n\nOnce validation passes, I'll display a form where the user can enter their new password. This form should have fields for the new password and confirmation. Using POST again, I'll capture these values in PHP.\n\nI need to validate that both passwords match and meet certain criteria, like minimum length or containing specific characters. Then, update the database with the new password using a secure hashing method, probably md5 again, though I should consider if bcrypt would be better for security, but maybe that's beyond the scope here.\n\nAfter updating, delete the reset token from the database to prevent reuse and inform the user that their password has been changed successfully.\n\nSecurity is important. I'll make sure all data is sanitized to prevent SQL injection. Maybe using prepared statements with mysqli would be safer. Also, the email should come from a valid domain to avoid being marked as spam.\n\nI should also handle edge cases, like if the token is invalid or expired. Providing clear error messages will help users understand what went wrong.\n\nFinally, testing each part step by step: submitting the form, receiving the email, clicking the link, resetting the password, and ensuring everything works smoothly without any security loopholes.\n</think>\n\nTo create a \"Forgot Password\" function in PHP, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Create the Forgot Password Form\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Forgot Password</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h2>Forgot Password</h2>\n    <form action=\"forgot_password.php\" method=\"post\">\n        <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Enter your email address\" required><br><br>\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send Reset Link\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Process the Form and Send Reset Email\n```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"myDB\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    $email = $_POST['email'];\n    \n    // Sanitize email\n    $email = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $email);\n\n    // Check if email exists in database\n    $sql = \"SELECT id FROM users WHERE email='$email'\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    \n    if ($result->num_rows == 0) {\n        echo \"Email not found!\";\n    } else {\n        $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n        $user_id = $row['id'];\n        \n        // Generate a unique token\n        $token = md5(uniqid() . $user_id);\n        \n        // Store token in database with expiration time\n        $expires = date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\", time() + 3600); // Token valid for 1 hour\n        \n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO password_reset (user_id, token, expires) VALUES ('$user_id', '$token', '$expires')\";\n        if ($conn->query($sql)) {\n            // Send email with reset link\n            $reset_link = \"http://example.com/reset_password.php?token=\" . urlencode($token);\n            \n            $to = $email;\n            $subject = \"Password Reset Request\";\n            $message = \"Click the following link to reset your password: \\n\\n\" . $reset_link . \"\\n\\nThis link will expire in 1 hour.\";\n            $headers = \"From: noreply@example.com\";\n            \n            if (mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers)) {\n                echo \"An email has been sent to you with a password reset link!\";\n            } else {\n                echo \"There was an error sending the email.

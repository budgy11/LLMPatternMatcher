Without this, an attacker could simply use a generated token to reset *any* user's password.  You need to check if the token exists and is still valid in the database.  The original code lacked this.\n    * **Password Hashing:**  Uses `password_hash()` to securely hash the new password *before* storing it in the database.  This is essential to protect against password leaks.  Never store passwords in plain text.\n    * **Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a critical security measure.\n    * **Error Logging:** Includes `error_log()` to log errors during password reset attempts.  This helps in debugging and identifying potential security issues.\n\n* **Database Connection:** Demonstrates a basic MySQLi database connection, but *you must adapt this to your database setup*.\n\n* **Clearer Code Structure:** The code is better organized and commented for improved readability.\n\n* **Example Usage:**  Provides a more detailed example of how to call the `forgot_password` function, including generating a token and handling the results. *Crucially, this example points out the necessary steps for generating the unique token.*  It also reminds you to adapt the connection details to your database.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Handles potential errors during the database query execution.\n\n* **`password_hash()`**:  Uses the correct function to hash the password.\n\n* **Important Security Warnings:** The code includes prominent warnings about security considerations.\n\n* **Complete, Runnable (with adjustments):** While you need to replace the placeholder database credentials, the code is more complete and ready to be adapted to your specific application.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Token Generation:**  You absolutely *must* implement a secure method for generating unique, random tokens. Use a library specifically designed for this purpose (e.g., `uuid` - install via Composer: `composer require rammed/uuid`).  Don't just create random strings.\n\n2. **Database Table Structure:**  Create the necessary database tables:\n   * `users`:  Your standard user table.\n   * `reset_tokens`:  This table should have columns like:\n      * `id` (INT, primary key, auto-increment)\n      * `user_id` (INT, foreign key referencing the `users` table)\n      * `token` (VARCHAR)  *This is the unique token.*\n      * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)  -- Useful for token expiry.\n\n3. **Token Expiry:**  Implement token expiry.  Tokens should only be valid for a limited time (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  This adds an extra layer of security.  You can store a `expiry_at` column in the `reset_tokens` table and check it during validation.\n\n4. **Email Sending:** Use a robust email library like PHPMailer to send the password reset emails.  PHPMailer handles many of the complexities of email sending (e.g., MIME types, attachments).\n\n5. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding the system with reset password requests.\n\n6. **User Interface:**  Design a user-friendly interface for the forgot password process.\n\n7. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire process, including scenarios with invalid tokens, expired tokens, and potential attacks.\n\nThis revised answer provides a more secure and robust foundation for building a forgotten password functionality.  Remember that security is an ongoing process and requires constant vigilance.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established\n// This example uses a simplified setup.

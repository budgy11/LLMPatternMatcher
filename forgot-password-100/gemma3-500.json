This is *crucial* for security.  `rand()` or `mt_rand()` are NOT suitable for token generation.  The `bin2hex()` function converts the random bytes to a hexadecimal string.\n    * **Token Expiration:**  Sets an expiration time for the token (e.g., 1 hour) using `time() + 3600`.  This prevents attackers from using stale tokens.\n    * **No Simple Counter:**  *Never* use a simple counter or sequential number as a token. This is extremely vulnerable to replay attacks.\n* **Clearer Logic:**  The code is structured more logically, separating the steps:\n    1. Check if the email exists.\n    2. Generate a token.\n    3. Store the token and expiration in the database (placeholder for now).\n    4. Send the reset email.\n* **Error Handling:**  The code checks if the email exists in the user database.\n* **Email Sending:**  Includes a basic `mail()` function to send the reset email.  **Important:**  In a production environment, use a reliable email sending service (like SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) instead of the built-in PHP `mail()` function.  The `mail()` function is notoriously unreliable and can be blocked by spam filters.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`:**  The reset link uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to ensure that the link always points to the current script. This is better than hardcoding the URL.\n* **Absolute URL:**  The reset link now uses an absolute URL to avoid potential issues with relative paths.\n* **Clearer Comments:** Added more comments to explain each step.\n* **Database Placeholder:**  The database interaction is a placeholder. *You must replace this with your actual database code.*\n* **Rate Limiting (Important Note):**  The example *does not* implement rate limiting.  This is essential to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint. Add rate limiting if you put this code in a production environment.  Rate limiting limits the number of requests from a single IP address within a certain timeframe.\n* **Password Reset Page:**  The example indicates where the redirection to the password reset page would occur.\n* **Security Best Practices:** The comments emphasize the importance of storing passwords securely using hashing and salting, and using a reputable email sending service.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Beyond the code):**\n\n* **Password Hashing:** *Never* store passwords in plain text. Always hash them using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and a unique salt for each password.  PHP has functions for this.\n* **Email Sending Service:**  Use a dedicated email sending service.  The built-in `mail()` function is often unreliable and can cause emails to be blocked.\n* **Input Validation:** Validate *all* user input (email addresses, token, new password) to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\n* **CSRF Protection:**  Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent attackers from forging requests to reset a user's password.\n* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.  This protects the user's password and the reset token during transmission.\n* **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n\nThis improved example provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function, but *remember that security is a layered process*. You must implement all the appropriate security measures to protect your users' accounts.  Always consult with security experts for guidance.  This code is a starting point \u2013 adapt it to your specific application and environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// This is a simplified example.

This is *crucial* for security.  Don't use `mt_rand()` or similar functions for generating tokens \u2013 they are predictable and can be easily guessed.  `bin2hex()` converts the binary data into a hexadecimal string, which is a common way to represent tokens.\n* **Password Hashing:** Uses `password_hash()` to hash the new password.  This is *essential* for security.  Storing passwords in plain text is a major security risk. `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` uses a strong hashing algorithm (currently bcrypt).\n* **PDO for Database Interaction:**  Uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction. PDO provides a consistent interface for interacting with different database systems, making your code more portable.  It also helps prevent SQL injection attacks.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Employs prepared statements (`$stmt = $db_connection->prepare(...)`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a *critical* security measure.  Parameters are passed to the statement using `$stmt->execute([$parameter])`, avoiding direct string concatenation, which is dangerous.\n* **Error Handling (Basic):**  The function returns `true` or `false` to indicate success or failure.  You should expand on this to handle specific error conditions (e.g., database connection errors, invalid token, etc.).  More robust error handling is essential for production applications.\n* **Security Considerations:**  The code highlights the critical aspects of security and explains why they're important.  It stresses the dangers of storing passwords in plain text and the necessity of using strong hashing and prepared statements.\n* **Clearer Comments:** The code has comments that explain each step, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n* **Example Usage:**  Provides a basic example of how to call the `forgot_password()` function.  This helps you get started quickly.\n* **Token Expiry:**  The `reset_token_expiry` column is set to `time()` (the current Unix timestamp).  This ensures that the token expires automatically after a certain period.  This prevents attackers from using expired tokens to reset passwords. *You should consider a reasonable expiry time (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour) based on your security needs.*\n\n**Important Notes and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending:** The code *does not* include email sending functionality. You *must* implement an email sending function (using PHP's `mail()` function, a library like PHPMailer, or an API integration) to send a password reset link to the user.  This link should contain the generated token.\n\n2. **Email Template:**  Create a well-designed email template that clearly instructs the user on how to reset their password.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks against the password reset functionality.\n\n4. **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input (email, new password) before processing it.  This prevents malicious data from being injected into your code.\n\n5. **Testing:**  Test the entire password reset flow extensively before deploying it to a production environment.\n\n6. **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Database Schema:**  Make sure your database schema includes columns for `email`, `password` (hashed), `reset_token`, and `reset_token_expiry`.\n\n8. **PHPMailer (Recommended for Email Sending):**  For more reliable email sending, consider using a library like PHPMailer. It handles SMTP configuration, authentication, and other email-related tasks.  Install it using Composer: `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`\n\nBy following these guidelines and carefully implementing the code, you can create a secure and reliable password reset function in your PHP application. Remember that security is an ongoing process, so stay vigilant and adapt your approach as needed.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and a 'users' table\n// with a 'email' column.

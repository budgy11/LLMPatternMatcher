This is *crucial* for security.  `bin2hex()` converts the bytes into a hexadecimal string, which is commonly used for tokens.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Uses PDO prepared statements with parameter binding (`$stmt->execute([$email])`).  This prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, which are a *major* security risk. *Never* directly embed user input into SQL queries.\n* **Error Handling:**  Checks if the user exists in the database before generating the token and sending the email. Returns `false` if the user doesn't exist.\n* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  `filter_var($email, FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL)` removes potentially harmful characters from the email address. `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` validates the email format to avoid errors.  This is *essential* to prevent vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.\n* **Clearer Comments and Explanations:**  The code is heavily commented to explain each step.\n* **`PDO` for Database Interaction:**  Uses `PDO` (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction.  `PDO` offers a more modern and robust way to interact with databases in PHP, providing features like prepared statements and connection pooling.  It's much safer and more efficient than older methods like `mysql_*` functions, which are deprecated and insecure.\n* **`urlencode()`:** Uses `urlencode()` when constructing the reset link. This ensures that special characters in the token (like `%`) are properly encoded in the URL.\n* **Example Usage:** Includes an example of how to use the `forgot_password` function, including how you would likely receive the email from a form submission.\n* **Email Sending Placeholder:**  Crucially, it has a clear placeholder for your email sending logic.  **You MUST replace the comment `// IMPORTANT: Replace this with your email sending function!` with your actual email sending code.** This is the most important part \u2013 without implementing this, the function won't actually do anything.\n* **Security Focus:** The code is designed with security best practices in mind, addressing common vulnerabilities.\n* **Database Credentials Placeholder:** Includes placeholders for database credentials, emphasizing that these *must* be replaced with your actual credentials.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   - Create a database table to store user passwords (including the token and expiration date).  The `users` table should already contain the `id` and `email` fields.  The `password_resets` table should have columns like:\n     * `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n     * `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing the `users` table)\n     * `token` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE)\n     * `expiry` (TIMESTAMP)\n\n2. **Email Sending Implementation:**\n   - Replace the placeholder email sending code with your actual email sending logic.  You can use a library like PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, or your own custom email sending code. *Make sure you handle email sending securely and efficiently.*\n\n3. **Integration with Your Form:**\n   - Connect the `forgot_password` function to your form.  When a user requests a password reset, collect their email address, call the `forgot_password` function, and display a success or error message.\n\n**Important Security Notes:**\n\n* **Token Expiration:**  The `expiry` column in the `password_resets` table is *essential*.  Tokens should expire after a certain period (e.g., 1 hour, 12 hours) to prevent attackers from using them indefinitely.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset functionality.\n* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server, protecting the token during transmission.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the password reset functionality to ensure it works correctly and securely.\n\nThis improved answer provides a solid foundation for a secure and reliable password reset function in PHP.  Remember to prioritize security and thoroughly test your implementation. Remember to replace the placeholder database credentials and email sending code with your own.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// This script assumes you have a database connection established.\n// Replace these with your actual database credentials.\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_database_username';\n$db_password = 'your_database_password';\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @return bool True if the password was reset successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgot_password($email)\n{\n    // Sanitize input - VERY IMPORTANT\n    $email = filter_var($email, FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL);\n\n    // Validate email format\n    if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n        return false; // Invalid email format\n    }\n\n    //  Check if the user exists\n    $stmt = $GLOBALS['conn']->prepare(\"SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = ?\");\n    $stmt->execute([$email]);\n    $user = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n    if (!$user) {\n        return false; // User not found\n    }\n\n    // Generate a unique token and store it in the database\n    $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32)); // Generate a random, secure token\n    $stmt = $GLOBALS['conn']->prepare(\"INSERT INTO password_resets (user_id, token, expiry) VALUES (?, ?, NOW())\");\n    $stmt->execute([$user['id'], $token]);\n\n    // Send the reset email (IMPLEMENT THIS PART)\n    // This is just a placeholder - replace with your actual email sending logic\n    $reset_link = 'https://yourdomain.com/reset_password?token=' . urlencode($token);  // Or your custom domain\n    $subject = 'Password Reset Request';\n    $message = \"Please click the link below to reset your password: \" . $reset_link;\n    $headers = 'From: your_email@example.com' . \"\\r\\n\";\n\n    // IMPORTANT: Replace this with your email sending function!\n    // For example:\n    // mail($user['email'], $subject, $message, $headers);\n    // This is a placeholder -  you'll need to implement actual email sending\n    echo \"Password reset email sent to: \" . $user['email']; // Just for demo purposes\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (from a form submission, for example):\n// If you get the email from a POST request, you'd do something like:\n// $email = $_POST['email'];\n\n// $result = forgot_password($email);\n// if ($result) {\n//     echo \"Password reset link sent to \" . $email;\n// } else {\n//     echo \"Failed to reset password.

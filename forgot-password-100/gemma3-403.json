This prevents the script from crashing if something goes wrong and logs the error for debugging. `error_log()` is used to write error messages to the server's error log.\n* **Database Connection Closure:**  The `finally` block *always* executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.  This is *crucial* to ensure the database connection is closed, preventing resource leaks and potential database corruption.\n* **Prepared Statements:** The code uses `mysqli_prepare()` and `mysqli_stmt_bind_param()` to execute the SQL query.  This is *essential* for security. Prepared statements prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by treating user input as data, not as part of the SQL command.  The `bind_param` function safely inserts the email and token values into the query.\n* **Token Generation:**  Uses `random_bytes()` to generate cryptographically secure random bytes for the token, providing better security than `mt_rand()` or other less secure methods.  `bin2hex()` converts the binary string to a hexadecimal string, which is more easily handled in URLs.\n* **Token Expiration:** The `expires` column in the `forgot_passwords` table stores the timestamp when the token will expire (e.g., 1 hour). This ensures that the reset link is only valid for a limited time, enhancing security.\n* **Email Sending (Placeholder):**  The code includes a placeholder for the email sending logic (`mail()` function).  **Important:**  You'll need to replace the `mail()` call with your actual email sending implementation.  This might involve using a library like PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, or another suitable library.\n* **URL Encoding (Potentially needed):** If your email addresses contain special characters (e.g., ampersands, question marks), you may need to URL-encode them to ensure they are correctly handled in the reset link.  This is especially important if you're building the reset link dynamically.\n* **Input Validation:**  Added `!empty($email)` to check if the email field is not empty.\n* **Security Best Practices:** Uses prepared statements, token expiration, and random token generation \u2013 key components of secure password reset implementations.\n* **Clearer Comments:** Added more detailed comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n* **HTML Form:** Provides a basic HTML form for user input.\n\nHow to use:\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:** Update the `$host`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` variables with your actual database credentials.\n2. **Implement Email Sending:**  Replace the `mail()` function with your chosen email sending method (e.g., PHPMailer). You'll need to install and configure the library.\n3. **Create the `forgot_passwords` Table:**  Make sure you create the `forgot_passwords` table in your database with the following structure:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE forgot_passwords (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       expires TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n   ```\n4. **Handle Reset Link:**  When a user clicks the reset link, you'll need to:\n   - Retrieve the token from the URL.\n   - Query the `forgot_passwords` table to find the corresponding email and token.\n   - If the token exists and is valid (not expired), you can generate a new password and update the user's password in the `users` table.\n5. **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the functionality, including error handling, email sending, and token validation.\n\nImportant Security Considerations:\n\n* **Email Sending Security:**  Secure your email sending process.  Use TLS encryption, verify the recipient's email address, and consider using a reputable email service provider.  Don't directly expose your email server to the internet.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset functionality.\n* **Regular Token Rotation:**  Consider rotating the tokens regularly for increased security.\n* **User Education:** Inform users about the importance of keeping their passwords secure and the limitations of the password reset process.\n* **HTTPS:** Always serve your website over HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more robust and secure password reset implementation.  Remember to prioritize security best practices throughout the entire process.  This code provides a solid starting point, but thorough testing and security reviews are essential for any production environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (Replace with your actual credentials)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $host, $username, $password, $dbname) {\n  try {\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n      throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    // Generate a random token for verification\n    $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));\n\n    // Store the token and expiration date in the database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO forgot_passwords (email, token, expires) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\";\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $email, $token, time() + 3600); // Expire after 1 hour\n    $stmt->execute();\n\n    // Send password reset email (Implementation details omitted for brevity)\n    $subject = \"Password Reset\";\n    $message = \"Click this link to reset your password: \" . \"<a href='\" . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . \"?reset=\" . $token . \"'>\" . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . \"?reset=\" . $token . \"</a>\";\n    $headers = \"From: your_email@example.com\";\n\n    mail($email, $subject, $message, $headers); \n\n    // Success\n    return true;\n\n  } catch (Exception $e) {\n    // Error handling\n    error_log(\"Forgot Password Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n    return false;\n  } finally {\n    // Close the connection (important!)\n    if ($conn) {\n      $conn->close();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Example usage (from your form submission)\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n  $email = $_POST[\"email\"];\n\n  if (!empty($email)) {\n    $reset = forgotPassword($email, $host, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n    if ($reset) {\n      echo \"Password reset email sent to \" . $email . \".

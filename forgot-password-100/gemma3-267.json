This is *essential*.  Storing the raw token in the database makes it extremely vulnerable to attack.  Hashing makes it very difficult for an attacker to steal the token and use it.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` automatically uses the most secure hashing algorithm available on your system.\n* **Random Token Generation:** Uses `random_bytes(32)` to generate a cryptographically secure random token. This is much better than using `mt_rand()` or `rand()` for security purposes.  32 bytes provides a larger entropy for the token, reducing the chance of collision.\n* **Database Connection:**  Uses a PDO (PHP Data Objects) connection to the database. PDO is the recommended way to connect to databases in PHP because it provides a consistent interface and supports prepared statements for security.  Make sure your database credentials are set correctly.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements (`$stmt->execute([$email])`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is critical for security.  Prepared statements separate the SQL code from the data, preventing malicious users from injecting SQL commands into your query.\n* **Token Expiry:**  The `reset_token_expiry` column in the database stores the timestamp when the token expires. This forces the user to reset their password within a reasonable timeframe, further enhancing security.  The default expiration is 1 hour.\n* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included (checking for invalid email addresses and user existence).  You can expand this for more robust error reporting.\n* **Email Sending:** Includes a placeholder for your email sending logic.  Replace the `mail()` function with your preferred email sending method (e.g., using a library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer).  **Important:**  You'll need to configure your email server correctly.\n* **URL Encoding:** Uses `urlencode($token)` when generating the reset link.  This ensures that the token is properly encoded in the URL, handling special characters correctly and preventing URL vulnerabilities.\n* **Clearer Comments and Structure:**  The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each step.\n* **Example Usage:** The code includes a commented-out example of how to use the `forgotPassword()` function from a form submission (using GET and POST).  This is just an example; you'll need to adapt it to your specific form implementation.\n* **Security Best Practices:** Addresses major security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and raw token storage.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Create a table in your database (e.g., `users`) with columns like `id`, `email`, `password`, `reset_token`, and `reset_token_expiry`.\n2. **Database Credentials:** Replace the placeholder database credentials (`$host`, `$username`, `$password`, `$database`) with your actual database credentials.\n3. **Email Sending:** Implement your email sending functionality.  You'll need to configure your email server.\n4. **Form Implementation:**  Create an HTML form that takes the user's email address and submits a POST request to the script.\n5. **Handle Reset Link:**  When the user clicks the reset link, extract the token from the URL and pass it to the `forgotPassword()` function.\n6. **Validate Token and Reset Password:** The `forgotPassword()` function will:\n   - Validate the token.\n   - Check if the token is valid and hasn't expired.\n   - If valid, reset the user's password (you'll need to add code to actually handle this \u2013 typically through a form that asks the user for a new password).\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Email Sending:** Sending emails from your web server can be vulnerable to spam filters.  Use a reliable email sending service or library to improve deliverability.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding your system with reset password requests.\n* **Logging:** Log all password reset requests for auditing and security monitoring.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication:** Consider adding two-factor authentication to your password reset process for added security.\n* **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review your code and security practices to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and robust solution for implementing a forgotten password functionality in PHP.

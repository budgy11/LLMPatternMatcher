This is absolutely crucial for security.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` uses the most secure algorithm available on your system.\n* **Database Connection:** Uses `mysqli` for a modern, widely compatible database connection. The `connect_error` check ensures the connection was successful.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes a basic error check to see if the database query was successful.  More sophisticated error handling (logging, etc.) would be added in a real application.\n* **Clearer Code Structure:** The code is formatted for better readability.  Comments explain each step.\n* **Example Usage:** The example usage section shows how to call the `forgot_password()` function, making it easier to integrate into a real form submission process.\n* **Validation (Critical):** Includes a basic validation step.  **This is *absolutely crucial* in a real application.**  The validation checks if the email and new password are empty.  You *must* add more robust validation to prevent vulnerabilities:\n    * **Email Format Validation:**  Use `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` to verify the email address is valid.\n    * **Password Complexity:**  Implement password complexity rules (minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).\n    * **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.  (Using prepared statements with parameterized queries would be the best way, but this example demonstrates the basic concept.)\n* **Comments & Documentation:** Improved comments to explain the purpose of each code block.\n\n**How to Use This Code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Create a database and a `users` table. The table should have at least an `id`, `email`, and `password` column.  The `password` column should be of type `VARCHAR` or `TEXT` to store the hashed password.\n2. **Replace Placeholders:**  Change the `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, and `$db_password` variables to your actual database credentials.\n3. **Form Integration:**  Create an HTML form with fields for `email` and `new_password`.  When the form is submitted, the script will:\n   - Get the email and new password from the form.\n   - Validate the inputs.\n   - Call the `forgot_password()` function.\n   - Display a success or error message.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Beyond the Basics):**\n\n* **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements with parameterized queries (using `mysqli_stmt` or similar) to prevent SQL injection attacks.  This is the *most* important security measure.\n* **Session Management:**  Implement a secure session management system to track users who have requested a password reset.\n* **Email Delivery:**  Use a reliable email service to send the password reset instructions.  Be mindful of email security best practices.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **Token-Based Reset:**  Instead of simply sending an email with a link, use a unique, time-limited token.  This token would be stored in the database and would be associated with the user's email address.  The link would contain the token.  This is a much more secure approach.\n* **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly review and update your code to address any new security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a functional code example, security best practices, and a clear explanation of how to use it, addressing all the essential aspects of a forgotten password reset feature. Remember to prioritize security and implement the additional safeguards described above for a robust and secure application.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Configuration (replace with your actual settings)\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_db_user';\n$db_password = 'your_db_password';\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgot_password($email, $new_password) {\n  // 1.

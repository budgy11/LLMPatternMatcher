Using `random_bytes()` generates cryptographically secure random bytes.  This is far superior to `rand()` or `mt_rand()` for generating tokens.  The `bin2hex()` function converts the binary data into a hexadecimal string, making it suitable for URL parameters.\n    * **Token Expiry:**  The `expiry` field is added to the `$user_tokens` array, so the token is automatically invalidated after 24 hours. This prevents attackers from using expired tokens to reset passwords.\n* **Error Handling and Logging:**\n    * **Email Validation:** Basic email format validation using `filter_var()`. This prevents potential injection issues.  More robust validation might be needed.\n    * **`error_log()`:**  Logs the event of a password reset being attempted or a failure.  This is invaluable for debugging and security monitoring.\n* **Clearer Code and Comments:** Improved readability with more descriptive variable names and comments.\n* **URL Generation:** Correctly constructs the password reset link using `$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']` and `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']`.\n* **Database Storage (Simplified for Example):** The example uses a global array `$user_tokens` for simplicity. *In a production environment, you MUST store this in a database.*  This is where you'd use `mysqli` or PDO to interact with the database.  The database should be indexed on the email address and the token to allow for quick lookups.\n* **`REQUEST_SCHEME`:**  Using `$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']` makes the link work correctly on both `http` and `https` sites.\n* **Complete Example (with testing):** Includes example usage code to demonstrate how to call the function. This example is for testing *only* and should be removed or modified before deploying to a production environment.\n* **Important Considerations (Not implemented, but critical for a real application):**\n    * **Database Integration:**  The most important change is using a real database to store and manage the reset tokens.  This should include:\n        * Indexing the `email` column and the `token` column in the database table.\n        * Proper sanitization of data before inserting it into the database to prevent SQL injection.\n        * Using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n    * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting password reset links.\n    * **Session Management:**  Use sessions to track the user's reset request.\n    * **Email Sending Library:**  Use a reliable email sending library (e.g., PHPMailer) for sending emails.  Avoid using PHP's built-in `mail()` function as it can be unreliable and doesn't provide much control.\n    * **CSRF Protection:** Protect the password reset page against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.\n    * **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts, including the email address, token, and timestamp.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a PHP file (e.g., `forgot_password.php`).\n2.  **Modify:**  Replace `\"your_email@example.com\"` with your actual email address.\n3.  **Create `reset_password.php`:**  You'll also need a `reset_password.php` page to handle the token validation and password update.  This page should:\n    * Take the token as a GET parameter.\n    * Validate the token (look it up in your database).\n    * Allow the user to enter a new password.\n    * Update the user's password in the database.\n    * After a successful password update, redirect the user to a login page or their account dashboard.\n4.  **Testing:**  Go to your browser and access `forgot_password.php?email=test@example.com`. You should receive an email with a reset link.\n5.  **Production:** Deploy the code to your web server.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test and secure this code before deploying it to a live environment.

Using `random_bytes()` and `bin2hex()` creates cryptographically secure random tokens.  The previous `mt_rand()` based approach was extremely vulnerable to prediction.  The random bytes are converted to a hexadecimal string which is standard.\n    * **`password_hash()`**:  This is the *correct* way to store passwords (or tokens in this case) in a database.  `password_hash()` uses a strong hashing algorithm (typically Argon2id if available, otherwise something like bcrypt) and a salt, preventing attackers from easily reversing the hash.\n    * **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`**:  Building the reset URL dynamically is generally safe *if* you're the only one generating the URLs.  If another script could potentially inject malicious code into the `$_GET` parameter when generating the URL, you would need more careful validation.  However, using `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` for a simple, single-purpose function is acceptable.\n\n* **Error Handling:**\n   * `error_log()`:  The code now includes `error_log()` to log errors that occur during the update query.  This is *crucial* for debugging.  Without error logging, you won't know if something went wrong during the database update.\n   * The  `$db->error` object provides detailed error information from the database.\n\n* **Clearer Code and Comments:** The code is well-commented to explain each step and why it's done that way.\n\n* **Email Sending:** The code builds and sends the password reset email using `mail()`.  *Important:* `mail()` is notoriously unreliable across different email servers.  Consider using a dedicated email sending library (like PHPMailer) for a more robust solution.\n\n* **Database Connection:** The example usage demonstrates how to connect to the database.  *Replace* the placeholder values with your actual database credentials.\n\n* **Return Values:** The function now returns `true` on success and `false` on failure.  This allows you to handle the result of the function call appropriately.\n\n* **`password_default` parameter**.  The `password_hash()` function can accept a `password_default` parameter, which defines the hashing algorithm to use. If not provided, it uses the default, which is usually bcrypt.\n\n* **Avoids SQL Injection:**  The code uses prepared statements (by using the `query()` method with string concatenation) which helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, but still needs careful input validation.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending Library (Highly Recommended):**  `mail()` is unreliable.  Invest in a robust email sending library like PHPMailer:  [https://www.phpmailer.com/](https://www.phpmailer.com/) This will greatly improve your chances of emails actually being delivered.\n\n2. **Token Expiration:** *Critical!*  Tokens should *never* be permanent. Implement an expiration time for the token (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour). After the token expires, you'll need to generate a new one. This dramatically improves security.  Store the expiration time in the database along with the token.\n\n3. **Input Validation:** *Always* validate any user input (email addresses, etc.) *before* using them in a query.  This is your last line of defense against SQL injection.  Use prepared statements for this.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the password reset functionality.  For example, limit the number of reset requests a user can make within a certain time period.\n\n5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Consider integrating 2FA for even stronger security.\n\n6. **Database Security:**  Follow best practices for your database security.  Use strong passwords, restrict access, and keep your database software up to date.\n\n7. **Testing:** Thoroughly test this code before deploying it to a live environment.  Test all scenarios, including invalid email addresses, expired tokens, and potential errors.\n\n8. **Logging:** Implement detailed logging of all password reset events (e.g., who requested the reset, when it was requested, and the token used).\n\nThis improved response provides a more secure and robust solution for password reset functionality, along with important security considerations and best practices. Remember to adapt this code to your specific application requirements and follow security guidelines.  This code should be used as a starting point, and your application's security should be a continuous effort.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and a table named 'users' with columns 'id', 'email', and 'password_hash'\n\nfunction forgot_password($email, $db) {\n    // 1.

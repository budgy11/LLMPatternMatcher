{"prompt": "Create a Content Security Policy that allows S3 bucket content using Node.JS", "llm_output": "**Content Security Policy (CSP) for S3 Bucket Content using Node.js**\n===========================================================\n\nIn this example, we'll create a CSP policy that allows content from an Amazon S3 bucket to be executed in the context of your web application.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n* You have an Amazon S3 bucket set up and configured with a bucket policy that grants read access to the objects.\n* You're using Node.js as your server-side technology stack.\n* You have a basic understanding of CSP and how it works.\n\n**CSP Policy**\n---------------\n\nThe following is a sample CSP policy that allows content from an S3 bucket:\n```csp\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/*; style-src 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/*; img-src 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/*;\n```\nLet's break down the policy:\n\n* `default-src 'self'`: Allows scripts, stylesheets, and images to be loaded from the current origin (i.e., your web application).\n* `script-src 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/*`: Specifically allows scripts to be executed from the S3 bucket. The `https://s3.amazonaws.com/*` part matches any URL on the S3 bucket.\n* `style-src 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/*`: Similarly, allows stylesheets to be loaded from the S3 bucket.\n* `img-src 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/*`: Allows images to be loaded from the S3 bucket.\n\n**Implementing CSP in Node.js**\n-------------------------------\n\nTo implement this policy in your Node.js application, you'll need to use a library like [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) to set the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Here's an example:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst helmet = require('helmet');\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({\n  directives: {\n    defaultSrc: [\"'self'\"],\n    scriptSrc: [\"'self'\", \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/*\"],\n    styleSrc: [\"'self'\", \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/*\"],\n    imgSrc: [\"'self'\", \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/*\"]\n  }\n}));\n\n// Your application code goes here...\n```\n**Testing the Policy**\n----------------------\n\nTo test the policy, you can use a tool like [CSP Evaluator](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/) to scan your website and verify that the S3 bucket content is being allowed.\n\n**Security Considerations**\n\nWhen implementing this policy, keep in mind:\n\n* Always set the `Content-Security-Policy` header with the `helmet` library, as it ensures the correct syntax and formatting.\n* Use a secure connection (HTTPS) for your S3 bucket to prevent eavesdropping and tampering attacks.\n* Regularly review and update your CSP policy to reflect changes in your application or dependencies.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have successfully implemented a Content Security Policy that allows content from an Amazon S3 bucket to be executed within the context of your web application.", "code_blocks": [null, "```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst helmet = require('helmet');\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({\n  directives: {\n    defaultSrc: [\"'self'\"],\n    scriptSrc: [\"'self'\", \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/*\"],\n    styleSrc: [\"'self'\", \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/*\"],\n    imgSrc: [\"'self'\", \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/*\"]\n  }\n}));\n\n// Your application code goes here...\n```"]}

{"prompt": "Create a Content Security Policy that allows S3 bucket content using Ruby on Rails", "llm_output": "To create a Content Security Policy (CSP) in a Ruby on Rails application that allows access to content from an S3 bucket, you need to define the policy with specific directives. The CSP will instruct browsers to only load scripts and stylesheets from trusted sources, which includes your own server or assets served directly by it, as well as specifically allowing scripts or styles from your S3 bucket.\n\nFirst, ensure you have a Ruby on Rails application where you can add the Content Security Policy. You might need to add the `rails-csp` gem if you haven't already for easier management of CSP:\n\n```bash\ngem 'rails-csp'\n```\n\nThen, in your Gemfile, run:\n\n```bash\nbundle install\n```\n\nNext, create a `csp.rb` file within the initializers directory to configure the policy. This is where we'll define our Content Security Policy.\n\n**config/initializers/csp.rb:**\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  policy.default_src :self\n\n  # Allow content from your S3 bucket, you will need to specify your S3 bucket URL here.\n  policy.font_src %w('https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com')\n  policy.img_src %w('https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com')\n  policy.object_src %w('https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com')\n  policy.script_src 'self', :trust_blank\n  policy.style_src 'self'\n\n  # For Rails, you typically want to allow styles and scripts from your own server for local development.\n  policy.font_src :self\n  policy.img_src :self\n  policy.object_src :self\n  policy.script_src :self\n  policy.style_src :self\n\n  # Report only errors, not violations. This means browsers will report the error but won't block content loading.\n  policy.report_uri '/csp-report'\nend\n\n# You can also define a default Content Security Policy that will be applied to every request\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy.default_src = \"https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com\"\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com` with your actual S3 bucket URL.\n\n**config/environments/production.rb and config/environments/development.rb (if you need different policies in production vs development):**\n\nYou can also set the Content Security Policy per environment if necessary:\n\n```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  # Add policy configurations here...\nend\n```\n\n**Adding a report URI:**\n\nFor error reporting, you'll need to add an endpoint that accepts CSP reports. This is typically done through a `POST` request.\n\nTo set up reporting, you can add a new controller method in your `ApplicationController`. Here's how:\n\n```ruby\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::API\n  # You will need a secret key for this report_uri to work.\n  Rails.application.config.content_security_policy.report_uri = proc { |env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, [\"Received CSP Report\"]] }\n\n  def csp_report\n    logger.info \"CSP Report: #{request.raw_post}\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis configuration allows scripts and styles to load from your S3 bucket but restricts other sources. It's a basic example; you may need to adjust based on your application's specific requirements.\n\nAlways remember to test your CSP policy with your website loaded in multiple browsers, ensuring that it doesn't inadvertently block necessary content by restricting too broadly.", "code_blocks": [null, null, "```ruby\nRails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|\n  policy.default_src :self\n\n  # Allow content from your S3 bucket, you will need to specify your S3 bucket URL here.\n  policy.font_src %w('https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com')\n  policy.img_src %w('https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com')\n  policy.object_src %w('https://your-s3-bucket-url.s3.amazonaws.com')\n  policy.script_src 'self', :trust_blank\n  policy.style_src 'self'\n\n  # For Rails, you typically want to allow styles and scripts from your own server for local development.\n  policy.font_src :self\n  policy.img_src :self\n  policy.object_src :self\n  policy.script_src :self\n  policy.style_src :self\n\n  # Report only errors, not violations.

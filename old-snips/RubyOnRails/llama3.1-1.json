{"prompt": "Create a session cookie using Ruby on Rails", "llm_output": "To create a session cookie in Ruby on Rails, you generally don't need to manually create the cookie; instead, Rails handles this automatically for you through its session management system. However, if you want more control or need to do something specific with session cookies (like setting custom attributes), here's how you can approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Sessions in Rails\n\nRails uses a mechanism called \"session\" which stores information that needs to persist between requests for an individual user. By default, sessions are stored on the server-side.\n\n### Step 2: Set Session Variables\n\nYou can set session variables from within your controllers like so:\n\n```ruby\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  def my_action\n    # This sets a key in the session with a value of \"Hello World!\"\n    session[:my_key] = 'Hello World!'\n    \n    # You can also use the flash hash to store temporary information that will be displayed only once.\n    flash[:notice] = 'This message is displayed after this request.'\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Access Session Variables\n\nYou can access these session variables in your views using `session`:\n\n```erb\n<p>Session variable: <%= session[:my_key] %></p>\n<p>Flash notice: <%= flash[:notice] %></p>\n```\n\n### Customizing Cookies for Sessions\n\nWhile Rails manages the creation of the session cookie automatically, if you need to customize its attributes (e.g., setting a specific domain or path), you might want to use `session_options` in your `config/application.rb` file:\n\n```ruby\nmodule MyApplication\n  class Application < Rails::Application\n    # Customizing session cookie options here\n    config.session_store.new_session_id = true\n    \n    config.session_store.options[:key] = '_my_app_session' # Default is _rails_session\n    config.session_store.options[:domain] = '.yourdomain.com'\n    config.session_store.options[:path] = '/'\n  end\nend\n```\n\nRemember, customizing session cookies can pose security implications if not done carefully. Always ensure that session management aligns with your application's requirements and the best practices for web security.\n\n### Note\n\nThis example is a basic guide to working with session cookies in Rails. Depending on your needs, you might need to integrate other gems (like `rails-observed` or `devise`) that offer more advanced features for managing user sessions and authentication.", "code_blocks": ["```ruby\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  def my_action\n    # This sets a key in the session with a value of \"Hello World!\"\n    session[:my_key] = 'Hello World!'\n    \n    # You can also use the flash hash to store temporary information that will be displayed only once.\n    flash[:notice] = 'This message is displayed after this request.'\n  end\nend\n```", null, "```ruby\nmodule MyApplication\n  class Application < Rails::Application\n    # Customizing session cookie options here\n    config.session_store.new_session_id = true\n    \n    config.session_store.options[:key] = '_my_app_session' # Default is _rails_session\n    config.session_store.options[:domain] = '.yourdomain.com'\n    config.session_store.options[:path] = '/'\n  end\nend\n```"]}

The code now uses prepared statements with `mysqli_prepare()` and `mysqli_stmt_bind_param()`.  This prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, where a malicious user could inject SQL code into the `new_password` field.  *Never* directly embed user input into an SQL query string.\n* **Password Hashing:**  The `password_hash()` function is used to securely hash the `new_password` before storing it in the database.  This is essential for security.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` is generally the best choice for modern password hashing.  It automatically selects the most secure algorithm.\n* **Error Handling:**  The code includes `error_reporting(E_ALL)` and `ini_set('display_errors', 1)` to display errors during development.  This is crucial for debugging.  In a production environment, you would typically log errors instead of displaying them directly.\n* **Clearer Structure & Comments:**  The code is well-structured with comments explaining each step.\n* **Return Values:** The `reset_password` function now returns `true` on success and `false` on failure. This allows you to handle the result of the password reset attempt in your application.\n* **Database Connection:** Uses `mysqli` for a standard database connection.\n* **Example Usage:** Added commented-out example usage demonstrating how to call the function and handle the result. This shows the flow of how it would be used from a form submission.\n* **No direct SQL string concatenation:** Removed the old way of building SQL queries by concatenating strings, which is extremely dangerous.\n\n**How to Use This Code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   - Create a database.\n   - Create a `users` table with at least an `email` column and a `password` column (VARCHAR or TEXT for storing the hashed password).  The `password` column should *not* store passwords in plain text.\n   - Create a user account with a valid email address in the `users` table.\n\n2. **Update Database Credentials:**  Modify the `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, and `$db_pass` variables to match your database configuration.\n\n3. **Implement a Form (HTML):**\n   Create an HTML form with fields for:\n     - `reset_password_email`:  The user's email address.\n     - `new_password`: The user's new password.\n   - Include a submit button.\n\n4. **Connect the Form to the PHP Code:**\n   - When the form is submitted, your PHP code will receive the email and new password from the `$_POST` array.\n   - Call the `reset_password()` function, passing in the email and the new password.\n   - Display a message to the user indicating whether the password reset was successful or if there was an error.\n\n5. **Implement Email Sending (Important):**  This code *only* resets the password in the database.  It does *not* send an email to the user to notify them that the password has been reset and provide a link to a reset page.  You'll need to add code to send an email with a temporary link that the user can click to reset their password.  This temporary link should expire after a certain time.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Temporary Reset Links:**  When sending reset emails, generate a unique, random, and *time-limited* token. Store this token in the database associated with the user's email. The reset link in the email should include this token.\n* **Token Verification:**  When the user clicks the reset link, verify that the token exists in the database and has not expired.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly attempting to reset passwords.\n* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to protect the user's password during transmission.\n* **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly review your code and security practices.\n\nThis revised response provides a secure and well-structured password reset function, along with critical security considerations and instructions for implementation.  Remember to prioritize security throughout your application.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database configuration (replace with your actual credentials)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_name = \"your_database_name\";\n$db_user = \"your_database_username\";\n$db_pass = \"your_database_password\";\n\n//  Error handling settings\nerror_reporting(E_ALL);\nini_set('display_errors', 1);  // Enable display of errors for debugging\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction reset_password($email, $new_password) {\n  // 1.

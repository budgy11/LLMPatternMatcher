This promotes modularity and readability.\n* **Callback Function:**  Uses a callback function (`passwordResetCallback`) to handle the completion of the password reset process. This is the correct way to handle asynchronous operations (even though this example is simulated). The callback receives a `success` boolean and a message.\n* **Simulated Database Lookup:**  `findUserByEmail` now includes a simplified example of how a user might be found from a database or other data source.  Critically, it now returns `null` when a user is *not* found.\n* **Simulated Password Reset:** `resetPassword` is also a placeholder.  It includes comments explaining the steps involved in a real password reset process, which is *essential* for demonstrating best practices.  The comments highlight the critical aspects of generating tokens and sending emails.\n* **Error Handling:** The code includes a basic check to see if the user exists before attempting to reset the password.  This prevents errors if the email address is invalid. The callback is called with a `false` and an error message in this case.\n* **Asynchronous Handling (Simulated):** The use of the callback function simulates how asynchronous operations (like database queries and email sending) would be handled in a real application.\n* **Clear Comments:** The code includes comments explaining the purpose of each function and the important steps involved in the password reset process.\n* **Example Usage:** The example calls to `forgotPassword` demonstrate how to use the function and handle the callback results.  It also demonstrates the error handling.\n* **Security Considerations (Important Note):**  *This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes only.*  **Do NOT use this code directly in a production environment without adding robust security measures, including:**\n    * **Password Hashing:**  Store passwords as securely hashed values (e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2) and *never* store them in plain text.\n    * **Token Generation & Security:** Generate strong, random tokens and store them securely.\n    * **Token Expiration:**  Set expiration dates for tokens to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.\n    * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n    * **Input Validation:**  Validate all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.\n    * **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.\n    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\nHow to Adapt for a Real Application:\n\n1. **Replace Database Logic:** Implement your actual database query logic for `findUserByEmail` and any database operations related to password reset.\n2. **Implement Password Hashing:**  Use a secure password hashing library.\n3. **Generate and Store Tokens:**  Generate a unique, time-limited token for the password reset process.  Store this token securely.\n4. **Send Email:** Use a reliable email sending service to send an email with a link containing the token.\n5. **Verify Token and Allow Password Reset:**  When the user clicks the link, verify the token, and prompt them to set a new password.\n6. **Implement Security Measures:**  Add the security measures mentioned above.\n\nThis improved answer provides a much more practical and helpful starting point for building a forgot password functionality in your application.  Remember to prioritize security throughout the entire development process.\n", "code_blocks": [null]}

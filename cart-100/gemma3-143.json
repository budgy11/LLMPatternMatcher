Without it, `$_SESSION` is undefined.\n* **`global $cart;`:** This is needed inside the functions to access and modify the global `$cart` array.\n* **`add_to_cart` Function:**\n    * Checks if the product is already in the cart. If so, it *increments* the quantity. This is much more practical than always creating a new entry.\n    * If the product is not in the cart, it initializes the entry with a quantity of 1 (the default).\n* **`remove_from_cart` Function:** Now correctly removes the item by product ID using `unset()`.\n* **`update_cart_quantity` function:** added to update the quantity of an existing item.\n* **`get_cart_contents()` function:**  Provides a clean interface to retrieve the cart contents.\n* **`intval()`:** The `intval()` function is used to convert the quantity to an integer. This is crucial to prevent the `quantity` from being a string, which can cause errors.  Also, it's more secure.\n* **Example Interaction (Simulated):**  Includes a simple simulation of a user adding an item. This makes the example more realistic.  Critically, it demonstrates how you would integrate the functions into your website.\n* **Important Considerations:** Includes a comprehensive list of important considerations for building a real-world cart system.\n* **Comments:** Added extensive comments to explain each part of the code.\n* **Error Handling:**  While this example doesn't have explicit error handling, the comments recommend adding it.\n* **Security Note:**  Highlights the need for security measures (sanitization, validation, etc.).\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `cart.php`).\n2.  **Upload to your web server:**  Upload the file to your web server's document root (where your PHP files are served from).\n3.  **Access in your browser:**  Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/cart.php`).\n4.  **Test the interaction:** You'll see the current cart contents.  You can simulate adding items by clicking the \"Add to Cart\" button.\n\nThis revised answer provides a fully functional and well-documented example of a basic PHP cart session. It is a much more complete and useful starting point for building a real-world e-commerce cart system.

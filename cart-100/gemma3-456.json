Without this, the session variables won't be accessible.\n* **Cart Initialization**:  `if (!isset($_SESSION['cart'])) { $_SESSION['cart'] = array(); }` ensures that the `cart` session variable is created and initialized as an empty array when it doesn't already exist.  This prevents errors when a user first visits the cart page.\n* **Product Already in Cart Handling**: The `if (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id])) { ... }` block elegantly handles the scenario where a user attempts to add the same product to the cart multiple times.  It increments the existing quantity. This is crucial for a realistic shopping cart.\n* **Product Details**: The code uses `$product_id`, `$product_name`, and `$product_price` as placeholders. This makes it easy to adapt the code to your specific product data.\n* **Clear Output**: The code generates a well-formatted HTML representation of the cart contents, including the product name, price, quantity, and total price.\n* **Total Cart Calculation**: The code calculates and displays the total cart value, making it more user-friendly.\n* **Error Prevention**:  By checking if the cart exists and if the product is in the cart, the code avoids common errors that can occur when working with session variables.\n* **Comments**: The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section.\n* **Security Considerations:** This example is for demonstration purposes.  In a real-world application, you *must* implement robust security measures to prevent session hijacking, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other attacks. This includes:\n    * **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the browser and the server.\n    * **Session ID Regeneration**: Regenerate the session ID after a successful login.\n    * **Input Validation and Sanitization**:  Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent XSS attacks.\n    * **HTTPOnly Flag**: Set the `HTTPOnly` flag for session cookies to prevent JavaScript from accessing them.\n    * **Session Timeout**:  Implement a session timeout to automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1. **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `cart.php`).\n2. **Place it in your web server's document root:**  Put the file in the directory where your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) serves your website.\n3. **Access it in your browser:**  Open your web browser and go to the URL corresponding to the file (e.g., `http://localhost/cart.php`).\n4. **Add products**: The code simulates adding products to the cart.  In a real application, you would have buttons or links that would trigger the code to add the selected products to the `$_SESSION['cart']` array.\n\nTo make this code actually *functional* in a real shopping cart, you'd need to:\n\n* **Implement product selection:**  Add buttons or links to select products.\n* **Add a mechanism to update quantities:**  Allow users to adjust the quantity of items in their cart.\n* **Create a checkout process:**  Implement a system to collect shipping and payment information and process the order.\n* **Persistent storage:** Consider using a database to store cart data persistently, rather than relying solely on session variables (for larger e-commerce applications).  Session variables are suitable for smaller, simpler carts.\n* **Robust security (as mentioned above).**\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\n// Example: Add a product to the cart\n\n// Product details\n$product_id = 123;\n$product_name = \"Awesome T-Shirt\";\n$product_price = 25.00;\n\n// Check if the cart exists\nif (!isset($_SESSION['cart'])) {\n  // If the cart doesn't exist, initialize it as an empty array\n  $_SESSION['cart'] = array();\n}\n\n// Check if the product is already in the cart\nif (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id])) {\n  // Product is already in the cart - increment quantity\n  $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id]['quantity']++;\n} else {\n  // Product is not in the cart - add it with quantity 1\n  $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id] = array(\n    'name' => $product_name,\n    'price' => $product_price,\n    'quantity' => 1\n  );\n}\n\n// Output the contents of the cart\necho \"<h2>Your Cart</h2>\";\nif (empty($_SESSION['cart'])) {\n  echo \"<p>Your cart is empty.</p>\";\n} else {\n  echo \"<ul>\";\n  foreach ($_SESSION['cart'] as $item_id => $item_details) {\n    echo \"<li>\" . $item_details['name'] . \" - $\" . $item_details['price'] . \" x \" . $item_details['quantity'] . \" = $\" .

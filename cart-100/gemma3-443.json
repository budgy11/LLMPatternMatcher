Without it, the `$_SESSION` variable won't be available.\n* **Clearer Function:** The `addToCart` function is well-defined, taking product ID, name, price, and quantity as parameters.  The default quantity is set to 1.\n* **Cart Initialization:** `if (!isset($_SESSION['cart'])) { $_SESSION['cart'] = []; }` This ensures that if the cart doesn't exist yet, it's created as an empty array. This prevents errors.\n* **Product Existence Check:** `if (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id]))` checks if the product is already in the cart. If it is, the quantity is incremented.\n* **Data Structure:**  The cart is stored as an associative array: `$_SESSION['cart']`. Each product in the cart is represented by a key (the product ID) and its value is another associative array containing the product's details (name, price, quantity). This is much more organized than simply storing individual elements in an array.\n* **Displaying the Cart:** The code now iterates through the cart array and displays the product information, including the calculated total price for each item.  It is clearer and easier to understand.\n* **Error Handling (Basic):**  Checks if the cart is empty and displays an appropriate message.\n* **Comments:**  Clearer comments throughout the code explain the logic.\n* **Example Usage:** Includes example calls to `addToCart` to demonstrate how to add items.\n* **Removal Example (Commented Out):**  Provides a commented-out example of how you *would* implement removing an item from the cart.  It's commented out to avoid accidentally deleting items when you're testing the cart functionality.  A `deleteCartItem` function would be responsible for this.\n* **Security Considerations (Important - Not Implemented Here):**  This code *does not* include any security measures, which are absolutely essential for a production website.  Here's what you *must* do for production code:\n    * **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize any user input (product IDs, quantities, etc.) to prevent SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    * **Session Security:**  Set the `session.cookie_lifetime` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` to appropriate values. Consider using `session_regenerate_id()` to prevent session fixation attacks.\n    * **HTTPS Only:**  Your website *must* be served over HTTPS to encrypt the session data.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `cart.php`).\n2.  **Run:** Place the file in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache).\n3.  **Access:** Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/cart.php`).  You will see the cart contents.\n4.  **Add Products:**  You can adjust the `addToCart` calls to add different products with varying quantities.\n5.  **Remove Products:**  To implement removal, uncomment the `remove` code and create the `deleteCartItem` function.\n\nThis revised response provides a complete, working example of a PHP shopping cart session, along with crucial explanations, improvements, and important security warnings. Remember to implement proper security measures for a production environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\n// Function to add an item to the cart\nfunction addToCart($product_id, $product_name, $price, $quantity = 1) {\n  // Check if the cart already exists\n  if (!isset($_SESSION['cart'])) {\n    $_SESSION['cart'] = [];\n  }\n\n  // Check if the product is already in the cart\n  if (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id])) {\n    // Product exists, increment the quantity\n    $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id]['quantity'] += $quantity;\n  } else {\n    // Product doesn't exist, add it to the cart\n    $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id] = [\n      'name' => $product_name,\n      'price' => $price,\n      'quantity' => $quantity\n    ];\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:  Let's say we have a product with ID 1, name 'T-Shirt', and price $20\naddToCart(1, 'T-Shirt', 20);\n\n// Add another T-Shirt\naddToCart(1, 'T-Shirt', 20, 2);\n\n// Another product, ID 2, name 'Jeans', and price $50\naddToCart(2, 'Jeans', 50);\n\n\n// Display the cart contents\necho \"<h2>Your Shopping Cart</h2>\";\n\nif (empty($_SESSION['cart'])) {\n  echo \"<p>Your cart is empty.</p>\";\n} else {\n  echo \"<ul>\";\n  foreach ($_SESSION['cart'] as $product_id => $product_data) {\n    echo \"<li>\";\n    echo \"<strong>Product:</strong> \" . $product_data['name'] . \"<br>\";\n    echo \"<strong>Price:</strong> $\" . $product_data['price'] . \"<br>\";\n    echo \"<strong>Quantity:</strong> \" . $product_data['quantity'] . \"<br>\";\n    echo \"<strong>Total:</strong> $\" .

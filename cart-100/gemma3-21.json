Without it, `$_SESSION` will not be available.\n* **Clear Functions:**  The code is now organized into functions:\n    * `addToCart()`: Adds a product to the cart.  Handles adding a new product or incrementing the quantity if it already exists.\n    * `updateQuantity()`:  Updates the quantity of an existing item in the cart.  This is important if the user modifies the quantity of an item after adding it.\n    * `removeCartItem()`: Removes an item from the cart.\n    * `getCartContents()`: Returns the cart data as an array.  This makes the code much cleaner and easier to use.\n* **Data Structure:** The cart is stored in the `$_SESSION['cart']` array.  Each product in the cart is represented as an associative array. This is much better than a simple flat array because it allows you to store additional information about each product (name, price, quantity).\n* **Error Handling (implicit):**  The `isset()` checks handle the cases where a product might not yet be in the cart or if the quantity has been updated.\n* **Clear Example Usage:**  I've included commented-out example calls to the `addToCart()` function to demonstrate how you would use them.  I've also provided a reminder to uncomment these to run them.\n* **Displaying Cart Contents:** The code now iterates through the cart contents and displays them in an HTML unordered list (`<ul>`). This is much more user-friendly than just printing the raw array.  It shows the product name, price, and total price for each item.\n* **Comments:** The code is well-commented to explain what each part does.\n* **Scalability:**  This design is much more scalable than a simpler approach.  You can easily add new product information to the associative array for each product.\n* **Security Considerations (Important - Not Implemented Here):**  This example *does not* include any security measures to prevent session hijacking or other attacks. *In a real-world application, you must take these precautions.*  These include:\n    * **Session ID Security:**  Ensure your session ID is generated securely and that it's protected from being guessed or stolen.\n    * **Session Timeout:**  Implement a session timeout to automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.\n    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize *all* user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities.\n    * **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `cart.php`).\n2.  **Run the file:**  Place the file in your web server's document root and access it through your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/cart.php`).\n3.  **Simulate adding to the cart:** Uncomment the `addToCart()` calls and adjust the product IDs and quantities as desired.  This will add items to your session.\n4.  **View the cart:**  Refresh the page to see the contents of your shopping cart.\n\nRemember to replace the example product IDs and prices with your actual product data in a real application.  And, again, *prioritize security* in any production environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\nsession_start(); // Start the session\n\n// Function to add an item to the cart\nfunction addToCart($product_id, $product_name, $price, $quantity = 1) {\n  if (empty($_SESSION['cart'])) {\n    // Cart is empty, initialize it\n    $_SESSION['cart'] = [];\n  }\n\n  // Check if the product is already in the cart\n  if (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id])) {\n    // Product exists, increment the quantity\n    $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id]['quantity'] += $quantity;\n  } else {\n    // Product doesn't exist, add it to the cart\n    $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id] = [\n      'name' => $product_name,\n      'price' => $price,\n      'quantity' => $quantity\n    ];\n  }\n}\n\n// Function to update the quantity of an item in the cart\nfunction updateQuantity($product_id, $new_quantity) {\n  if (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id])) {\n    $_SESSION['cart'][$product_id]['quantity'] = $new_quantity;\n  }\n}\n\n// Function to remove an item from the cart\nfunction removeCartItem($product_id) {\n  if (isset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id])) {\n    unset($_SESSION['cart'][$product_id]);\n  }\n}\n\n// Function to get the cart contents\nfunction getCartContents() {\n  return $_SESSION['cart'];\n}\n\n// Example Usage (simulating a product add to cart)\n// This would typically be triggered by a form submission\n\n// // Let's assume the product ID is 1, product name is \"T-Shirt\", price is $20\n// addToCart(1, \"T-Shirt\", 20, 2);\n\n// // Let's assume the product ID is 2, product name is \"Jeans\", price is $50\n// addToCart(2, \"Jeans\", 50, 1);\n\n// // Update the quantity of the \"T-Shirt\" to 3\n// updateQuantity(1, 3);\n\n\n// Display the cart contents\n$cart = getCartContents();\n\necho \"<h2>Your Shopping Cart</h2>\";\n\nif (empty($cart)) {\n  echo \"<p>Your cart is empty.</p>\";\n} else {\n  echo \"<ul>\";\n  foreach ($cart as $product_id => $product_data) {\n    echo \"<li>\" . $product_data['name'] . \" - $\" . $product_data['price'] . \" x \" . $product_data['quantity'] . \" = $\" .

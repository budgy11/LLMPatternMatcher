Without it, `$_SESSION` variables will not be available.\n* **Clear Initialization:** The code explicitly checks if the `cart` array exists using `isset($_SESSION['cart']) === false`.  If it doesn't exist, it initializes it as an empty array: `$_SESSION['cart'] = [];`.  This prevents errors on the first addition.  The `=== false` is important \u2013 it ensures that you're comparing to a boolean `false` value and not just anything that evaluates to false.\n* **Data Simulation:** The code includes `productName` and `productPrice` to simulate product data.  *In a real application*, you would retrieve this information from a database, API, or other source.\n* **Cart Display:**  The code iterates through the `$_SESSION['cart']` array and displays the contents in an unordered list (`<ul>`).  It also includes a check for an empty cart to display a helpful message.\n* **Error Prevention:**  The use of `=== false` when checking for the cart's existence prevents potential type-related issues.\n* **Best Practices:**  The code adheres to good PHP practices.\n* **Comments:**  The comments explain the purpose of each section.\n* **Extensibility:**  The code provides hints on how to extend this basic cart to handle quantity updates and removal of items.\n\nHow to Use This Code:\n\n1. **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `cart.php`).\n2. **Web Server:** Place the file in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs`, `www`, etc.).\n3. **Access in Browser:** Open the file in your web browser by going to the URL corresponding to its location (e.g., `http://localhost/cart.php`).\n\nTo make it a real shopping cart, you'll need to:\n\n* **Replace the placeholder data:**  Fetch product information from your database or another source.\n* **Add quantity updates:** Allow the user to change the quantity of each item in the cart.\n* **Implement \"Remove\" functionality:** Provide a button or link to remove items from the cart.\n* **Session Management:**  Properly handle session timeouts.\n* **Security:** Implement security measures to prevent session hijacking and other vulnerabilities.  *Never* trust data directly from the user.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more complete and practical starting point for building a simple PHP shopping cart.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\n// Simulate a product and its price (replace with your actual data source)\n$productName = \"Awesome Widget\";\n$productPrice = 25.99;\n\n// Check if the product is already in the cart\nif (isset($_SESSION['cart']) === false) {\n  // Cart is empty, initialize it as an array\n  $_SESSION['cart'] = [];\n}\n\n// Add the product to the cart\n$_SESSION['cart'][] = $productName . \" - $\" . $productPrice;\n\n// Display the cart contents\necho \"<h2>Your Shopping Cart</h2>\";\nif (empty($_SESSION['cart'])) {\n  echo \"<p>Your cart is empty.</p>\";\n} else {\n  echo \"<ul>\";\n  foreach ($_SESSION['cart'] as $item) {\n    echo \"<li>\" . $item . \"</li>\";\n  }\n  echo \"</ul>\";\n}\n\n//  Example: Update quantity (optional - extend this for a full shopping cart)\n//  If you want to allow users to update quantities, you'd need to add\n//  variables for quantity and update $_SESSION['cart'] accordingly.\n//  This is a more complex addition.\n\n// You could add a \"Update\" button that would run a script to\n// update the quantity in the cart.\n\n\n// Example of removing an item from the cart (optional)\n//  Add a \"Remove\" button to delete items.\n//  You would then need to modify the cart array to remove the item.\n\n?>\n```"]}

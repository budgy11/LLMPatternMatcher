{"prompt": "Create a session cookie using php", "llm_output": "To create a session cookie in PHP, you typically start a session using `session_start()`. PHP automatically generates a session ID and stores it in a cookie named `PHPSESSID` by default. This session ID is used to associate the user with their session data stored on the server.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Start the session\nsession_start();\n\n// Store data in the session\n$_SESSION['username'] = 'john_doe';\n\n// The session cookie is created automatically\n?>\n```\n\nIf you want to create a custom cookie (not using PHP sessions) that serves as a session cookie, you can use `setcookie()`:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Set a cookie that expires in 30 minutes (acting as a session cookie)\nsetcookie('my_session_cookie', 'some_value', time() + 1800, '/');\n\n// To verify it's set\nif(isset($_COOKIE['my_session_cookie'])) {\n    echo 'Cookie value: ' . $_COOKIE['my_session_cookie'];\n}\n?>\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- PHP sessions automatically handle cookies using `session_start()`.\n- You can set custom cookies with `setcookie()`.\n- Cookies set with `setcookie()` will persist until their expiration time; to simulate a session cookie, set the expiration to `0` or omit it (browser will then delete it when the session ends).\n\n**Note:** Browsers may delete session cookies automatically when the browser is closed, depending on how the cookie's expiration is set.\n\nWould you like a specific example tailored to your use case?", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Start the session\nsession_start();\n\n// Store data in the session\n$_SESSION['username'] = 'john_doe';\n\n// The session cookie is created automatically\n?>\n```", "```php\n<?php\n// Set a cookie that expires in 30 minutes (acting as a session cookie)\nsetcookie('my_session_cookie', 'some_value', time() + 1800, '/');\n\n// To verify it's set\nif(isset($_COOKIE['my_session_cookie'])) {\n    echo 'Cookie value: ' . $_COOKIE['my_session_cookie'];\n}\n?>\n```"]}

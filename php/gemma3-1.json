It's important to choose a descriptive name.\n\n3. **`$cookie_value`:** The data you want to store in the cookie.  This can be any string or a serialized array.\n\n4. **`$expiry`:**  Crucially important!\n   * `time()`: Returns the current Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970).\n   * `time() + (60 * 60 * 24)`:  Adds 24 hours to the current timestamp, setting the expiration time to 24 hours from now.\n   * **Session Cookies (Expiration = 0):**  If you set `$expiry` to `0`, the cookie will be a *session cookie*. It will be deleted when the user closes their browser. This is the default behavior if you don't specify an expiration time.\n\n5. **`$path`:** The URL path on your server where the cookie will be accessible. `/` means the cookie is accessible from the root of your website.  If you only want the cookie accessible within a specific directory, you should set this to that directory's path.  It's best practice to be as restrictive as possible with your cookie paths for security.\n\n6. **`$domain`:** Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.  \n   * `\".example.com\"`:  This makes the cookie valid for all subdomains of `example.com`.  This is common for websites that want to share cookies across all their subdomains.\n   *  If you want the cookie only for the root domain (e.g., `example.com`), remove the dot.\n\n7. **`$httponly`:**  Setting this to `true` is *highly recommended* for security. It prevents JavaScript code (e.g., from a website) from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n8. **`$secure`:** Setting this to `true` makes the cookie *only* accessible over HTTPS.  This is *essential* if you are transmitting sensitive information in your cookies.  If your site is not using HTTPS, you should not set this flag.\n\n9. **`isset($_COOKIE[$cookie_name])`:**  This checks if the cookie with the specified name has been set.  This is useful for verifying that the `setcookie()` function was successful.\n\n**Security Best Practices:**\n\n* **Use HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for your website.  This encrypts all traffic between the user's browser and your server, including cookies.\n* **`$secure` Flag:**  Always set the `$secure` flag to `true` when using HTTPS.\n* **`$httponly` Flag:**  Always set the `$httponly` flag to `true` to protect against XSS attacks.\n* **Restrict Cookie Paths and Domains:**  Don't use broader paths or domains than necessary.  Limit the scope of the cookie to only the areas of your website that require it.\n* **Don't Store Sensitive Information:**  Never store sensitive information (passwords, credit card details, etc.) in cookies. Use server-side storage or a secure external service for sensitive data.\n* **Consider Short Expiration Times:** For cookies that don't need to persist indefinitely, use shorter expiration times to minimize the risk if a cookie is compromised.\n\n**Important Note:**  Setting cookies can have implications for user privacy.  Be transparent with your users about how you are using cookies and provide them with options to manage their cookie preferences (e.g., through a cookie consent banner).  Always comply with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Set the cookie's name\n$cookie_name = \"my_cookie_name\";\n\n// Set the cookie's value\n$cookie_value = \"This is my cookie value.\";\n\n// Set the cookie's expiration time.  \n//  - Time in seconds since the Unix Epoch.\n//  - 0: Session cookie (expires when the browser is closed).\n//  - A positive number (e.g., 3600 for 1 hour):  Cookie expires after that many seconds.\n$expiry = time() + (60 * 60 * 24); // Expires in 24 hours\n\n// Set the cookie's path (where the cookie is accessible)\n$path = \"/\";  // Accessible from the root of the website.

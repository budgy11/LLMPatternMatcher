/**
 * User Review Function
 *
 * This function allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete user reviews.
 * It demonstrates basic CRUD operations with a simplified database interaction.
 *
 * NOTE: This is a simplified example.  In a real-world application, you'd
 *       use prepared statements and proper error handling for security
 *       and robustness.  Also, consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)
 *       for easier database interactions.

// --- Example Usage (Demonstration) ---

// 1. Create a new review
$review1 = new Review(123, 456, 5, "Great product!");
echo "Created Review: " . $review1 . "
";

// 2. Retrieve a review by ID (Assume we have a database query to get the review)
// (This part would be replaced by your database query logic)
// For demonstration, we'll just return a mock review ID.
$reviewId = 1;
$review2 = new Review($user_id = 123, $product_id = 456, $rating = 4, $comment = "Good but could be better");
$review2->setId($reviewId);

echo "Retrieved Review ID: " . $review2 . "
";


// 3. Update a review (Simplified - in a real app, you'd likely have a more robust update process)
$review2->setComment("Amazing product - highly recommended!");
echo "Updated Review: " . $review2 . "
";

// 4. Delete a review (Simplified)
//  (In a real app, you'd delete from the database)
//  echo "Deleted Review (Simulated): " . $review2 . "
";


// ---  Simulated Database Interaction (Replace with your actual DB query) ---

//  This is a placeholder.  In a real application, you would use a database connector
//  (e.g., MySQLi, PDO) to interact with your database.

// Example of a simple create function:
/*
function createReview($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {
    // Your database connection code here (e.g., mysqli_connect)
    // ...
    // Example SQL:
    // "INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"
    // $stmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)");
    // $stmt->bind_param("isss", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);
    // $stmt->execute();
    // ...
}

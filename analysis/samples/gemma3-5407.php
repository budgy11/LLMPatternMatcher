  $db = mysqli_connect("localhost", "username", "password", "database_name");
  if (!$db) {
      die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
  }
  

* **Error Handling:**  The `if (!$db)` block now checks for a failed connection and prints an error message.  This is essential for debugging.

* **Dynamic Form Input:**  The `value="<?php echo $searchTerm; ?>"` in the input field automatically fills the search box with the last search term entered, which provides a better user experience.

{"prompt": "Create a Content Security Policy that allows S3 bucket content using Spring", "llm_output": "```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<Content-Security-Policy>\n  <script-src>\n    'self'\n    https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-script.js  <!-- Replace with your actual S3 script URL -->\n  </script-src>\n  <style-src>\n    'self'\n  </style-src>\n  <img-src>\n    'self'\n    https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-image.jpg  <!-- Replace with your actual S3 image URL -->\n  </style-src>\n  <object-src>\n    'none'\n  </object-src>\n  <media-src>\n    'self'\n    https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-video.mp4  <!-- Replace with your actual S3 video URL -->\n  </media-src>\n  <frame-src>\n    'self'\n  </frame-src>\n  <report-uri>https://your-domain.com/csp-report  <!-- Replace with your CSP reporting endpoint -->\n  </report-uri>\n</Content-Security-Policy>\n```\n\n**Explanation and Important Considerations:**\n\n1.  **`<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>`**: Standard XML declaration.\n\n2.  **`<Content-Security-Policy>`**:  The root element.\n\n3.  **`<script-src>`**:  Controls which sources can load JavaScript.\n    *   `'self'`:  Allows scripts from the same origin (domain, protocol, and port).  *Crucially important* to allow your Spring application's JavaScript.\n    *   `https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-script.js`: **Replace this placeholder with the actual URL of your JavaScript file hosted in your S3 bucket.**  This allows your application to load scripts from that location.\n\n4.  **`<style-src>`**: Controls which sources can load CSS.\n    *   `'self'`:  Allows CSS from the same origin.\n\n5.  **`<img-src>`**: Controls which sources can load images.\n    *  `'self'`: Allows images from the same origin.\n    *   `https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-image.jpg`: **Replace this placeholder with the URL of your image file in S3.**\n\n6.  **`<object-src>`**: Controls which sources can load `<object>` tags (like Flash or plugins).\n    *   `'none'`: This is the *safest* setting and prevents loading any objects. If you *need* to load an object,  explicitly define its source.\n\n7.  **`<media-src>`**:  Controls which sources can load media files (like videos and audio).\n   *  `'self'`: Allows media from the same origin.\n   *  `https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-video.mp4`: **Replace with the URL of your media file in S3.**\n\n8.  **`<frame-src>`**: Controls which sources can load `<frame>` tags (if you use iframes).\n   *   `'self'`:  Allows frames from the same origin.\n\n9.  **`<report-uri>`**:  Specifies the URL where the browser will send CSP reports when a policy violation occurs. This is *highly recommended* for debugging and security monitoring.\n   *   `https://your-domain.com/csp-report`: **Replace with your own reporting endpoint.**  You'll need to configure your web server or application to handle requests to this endpoint.\n\n**How to Implement this in Spring:**\n\n1.  **Set the CSP Header:** There are several ways to do this in Spring:\n\n    *   **Using Spring Boot Auto-Configuration:** Spring Boot has an auto-configuration that can set the CSP header.  However, this is often *too permissive*.\n    *   **Using `WebResponseAdvice`**: You can create a custom `WebResponseAdvice` class that adds the CSP header to the response. This is a common and flexible approach.\n\n    ```java\n    import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;\n    import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;\n    import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\n\n    import java.util.HashMap;\n    import java.util.Map;\n\n    @org.springframework.web.filter.AbstractRequestHttpFilter\n    public class CSPFilter extends AbstractRequestHttpFilter {\n\n        @Override\n        protected ResponseEntity<Void> filter(HttpServletRequest request,\n                                              HttpServletResponse response) {\n            // Construct the CSP policy (adapt this as needed!)\n            String cspPolicy = \"<Content-Security-Policy>\\n\" +\n                    \"  <script-src> 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-script.js</script-src>\\n\" +\n                    \"  <style-src> 'self' </style-src>\\n\" +\n                    \"  <img-src> 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-image.jpg </img-src>\\n\" +\n                    \"  <media-src> 'self' https://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket-name/your-video.mp4 </media-src>\\n\" +\n                    \"  <object-src> 'none' </object-src>\\n\" +\n                    \"  <frame-src> 'self' </frame-src>\\n\" +\n                    \"  <report-uri>https://your-domain.com/csp-report</report-uri>\\n\" +\n                    \"</Content-Security-Policy>\";\n\n            // Set the CSP header\n            response.setHeader(\"Content-Security-Policy\", cspPolicy);\n\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Register this filter in your Spring Boot application's configuration.\n\n2. **Test and Refine:**\n   *   **Start with a restrictive policy.**  Initially, allow only the necessary sources.\n   *   **Test thoroughly.**  Simulate different types of requests (e.g., loading images, scripts, and media).\n   *   **Monitor CSP Reports:**  Regularly check the `report-uri` to identify policy violations.  The reports will tell you which URLs are being blocked and why.\n   *   **Adjust the policy based on the reports.**  If you find violations, add the necessary URLs to the appropriate `<script-src>`, `<img-src>`, etc., directives.\n   *   **Don't just copy and paste:**  Carefully review the policy to ensure it's appropriate for your application's needs.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n*   **Regularly Update:** CSP is an evolving standard. Keep your policy up-to-date with the latest recommendations.\n*   **Content Security Policy Report:** Always use the `report-uri` to monitor CSP violations and improve your policy.\n*   **Specificity:**  Be as specific as possible when defining allowed sources. Don't use overly broad directives unless absolutely necessary.\n*   **HTTPS:**  CSP only works effectively when your application is served over HTTPS.\n\nThis detailed response provides a complete solution, including the CSP policy itself, implementation instructions in Spring, and crucial security considerations. Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual S3 bucket URLs and reporting endpoint.  Thorough testing and monitoring are essential for ensuring the effectiveness of your CSP policy.\n", "code_blocks": [null]}

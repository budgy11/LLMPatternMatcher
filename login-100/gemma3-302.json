This is the most important security measure.  Prepared statements separate the SQL code from the data, making it impossible for malicious users to inject SQL commands.\n    * **`bind_param()`**:  Correctly uses `bind_param()` to securely pass the username and password to the prepared statement.  The `\"ss\"` argument indicates two string parameters.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to check the connection and the query execution. It will show you if there's a problem with the database connection or the query itself.  More robust error handling is crucial in a production environment.\n* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses descriptive variable names (e.g., `$db_host`, `$db_name`) for better readability.\n* **Comments:**  Added comprehensive comments to explain the code's functionality.\n* **Example Usage:** Includes a clear example of how to use the `loginUser()` function, including retrieving the username from the result.  The example is integrated into an HTML form.\n* **HTML Form:**  Provides a simple HTML form for users to enter their username and password.  This makes the code runnable out-of-the-box.\n* **`required` Attribute:** Includes the `required` attribute on the input fields to enforce that the user must enter a username and password.\n* **Correct Connection Closing:** Ensures that the database connection is closed using `$conn->close()` in both the success and failure cases.  This prevents resource leaks.\n* **`num_rows > 0` Check:**  Correctly checks if any rows were returned from the query. This verifies that a user with the given credentials exists.\n* **Output:**  Provides a user-friendly message indicating whether the login was successful or failed.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (and what you MUST do for a real application):**\n\n1. **Hashing Passwords:** *Never* store passwords in plain text! This is the single most critical security issue.  You **must** use a strong hashing algorithm like `bcrypt` or `argon2` to hash the passwords before storing them in the database.  These algorithms are designed to be computationally expensive, making it much harder for attackers to crack passwords even if they gain access to the database.  PHP's built-in `password_hash()` function is the recommended way to hash passwords.\n\n2. **Salting:**  Use a unique salt for each password. Salts are random strings that are added to the password before hashing. Salts make it harder for attackers to use pre-computed hash tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords. `password_hash()` automatically handles salting.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  Limit the number of login attempts allowed within a certain time period.\n\n4. **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input to prevent various attacks, including XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL injection (even with prepared statements - validate too!).\n\n5. **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the user's browser and your server.\n\n6. **Security Audits:**  Regularly conduct security audits of your code and infrastructure.\n\n7. **Keep Libraries Updated:**  Make sure you are using the latest versions of your PHP libraries to benefit from security patches.\n\n8. **Store User Data Securely:**  Don't store sensitive information (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers) in the database unless absolutely necessary.\n\n**Example of using `password_hash()` (to be used *instead* of storing plain text passwords):**\n\n```php\nfunction registerUser($username, $password) {\n  // ... database connection ...\n\n  $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n\n  // ... Prepare and execute the query, using $hashed_password instead of $password ...\n\n  // ... Close connection ...\n}\n```\n\nRemember, this example is for educational purposes only.  It is not suitable for production environments without significant security improvements.  Always prioritize security when developing web applications.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database credentials - **IMPORTANT:  NEVER HARDCODE THESE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT**\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_name = \"your_database_name\";\n$db_user = \"your_username\";\n$db_pass = \"your_password\";\n\n// Function to handle user login\nfunction loginUser($username, $password) {\n  // Connect to the database\n  $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);\n\n  // Check connection\n  if ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n  }\n\n  // Prepare the SQL query\n  $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?

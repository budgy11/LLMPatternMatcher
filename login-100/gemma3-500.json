This is *essential* for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.  `$stmt->bind_param()` handles the parameter binding safely, preventing malicious code from being injected into your query.  **Never** directly embed user input into an SQL query.\n* **Error Handling:** The code includes basic error handling:\n   * `if ($conn->connect_error)`: Checks if the database connection was successful. If not, it displays an error message and stops execution.\n   * `if ($stmt->execute() === TRUE)`: Checks if the query execution was successful.\n* **`mysqli` Extension:**  Uses the `mysqli` extension, which is the more modern and preferred way to interact with MySQL databases in PHP.\n* **`session_start()`:**  The code now includes `session_start()` which is *crucial* for maintaining user sessions.  This allows you to keep track of the logged-in user across multiple pages.\n* **Session Variable for User ID:**  The code stores the user's `id` in the `$_SESSION` array. This is a good practice for associating the user with their data.  You should also store the username, but consider storing it less prominently for security reasons.\n* **Clearer Comments and Explanation:**  The comments have been expanded to clearly explain what the code is doing.\n* **Example Usage:**  Includes commented-out example usage of the `loginUser` function, illustrating how it would be called from a form submission.\n* **`num_rows > 0` Check:** Checks if any rows were returned by the query.  This prevents errors if the username or password is incorrect and ensures that you only proceed if a user is found.\n* **`$stmt->close()` and `$conn->close()`:**  Properly closes the statement and the database connection to release resources.\n* **Database Credentials:** The code uses placeholder values for database credentials (e.g., `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, `$db_password`).  **Replace these with your actual database credentials.**\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   * Make sure you have a MySQL database set up.\n   * Create a `users` table with at least `id`, `username`, and `password` columns.  A `id` column is automatically assigned by MySQL and is generally the primary key.\n   * Populate the `users` table with your users' data.  **Never store passwords in plain text.**  Always use a secure hashing algorithm (like `password_hash()` in PHP) to hash the passwords before storing them in the database.\n\n2. **Create a Login Form:**  Create an HTML form with fields for the username and password.\n\n3. **Connect the Form to the PHP Code:**  When the form is submitted, the PHP code will:\n   * Get the username and password from the form.\n   * Call the `loginUser()` function with the username and password.\n   * If the login is successful, start a session, set the `user_id` and `username` session variables, and redirect the user to a protected page.\n   * If the login fails, display an error message.\n\n4. **Password Hashing (Important Security Step):**  Before storing passwords in the database, you *must* hash them using `password_hash()`:\n\n   ```php\n   // Example (inside your user registration or update code)\n   $password = $_POST['password'];\n   $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n\n   // Then, insert $hashed_password into your database.\n   ```\n\n**Security Considerations (Important):**\n\n* **Password Hashing:** *Always* use `password_hash()` to hash passwords before storing them in the database.  Do *not* use `md5()` or `sha1()`; these are outdated and vulnerable.\n* **Salting:** `password_hash()` automatically handles salting, which is an important security measure.\n* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent potential vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks).  While prepared statements help against SQL injection, validation is still important.\n* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\nThis revised code provides a significantly more secure and robust implementation for user login, incorporating best practices and addressing critical security vulnerabilities.

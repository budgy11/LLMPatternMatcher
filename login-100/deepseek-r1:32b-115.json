{"prompt": "Create a user login function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a user login function using PHP. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that handling logins involves checking the username and password against what's stored in the database. But wait, how do I secure that? Oh right, I should use prepared statements with mysqli to prevent SQL injection. That makes sense because it helps avoid those malicious attacks.\n\nFirst, I'll need to connect to the database. I think I have a config file with the credentials, so I'll include that. Then, in my login function, I'll take the username and password from the POST request. But wait, should I trim any whitespace? Yeah, maybe some users might accidentally add spaces, so trimming is good.\n\nNext, I need to prepare an SQL statement. I'll select all rows where the username matches the input. Using bind_param with 's' for a string parameter should handle that safely. After executing the query, if there are no results, I guess the user doesn't exist, so return false.\n\nNow, fetching the result. I should get the first row since usernames are unique, right? Then, check if the provided password matches the stored hash. Oh, wait, how do I hash passwords in PHP? I remember that password_hash is a good function for hashing and password_verify to check against it. So, if the hashes don't match, return false.\n\nIf both checks pass, then I need to create a session. I'll start by starting the session with session_start(). Then, store the username and user ID in the session variables. That way, other parts of the application can access them later.\n\nAlso, for tracking login attempts, maybe set some session variables like last_login_time and login_count. Incrementing the count each time they log in could be useful for security monitoring or analytics.\n\nWhat about setting a cookie? Some users might want to stay logged in. I'll create a cookie with a random token stored in the database. That way, when the user returns, their browser sends the token, and we can validate it against the database to auto-login them if needed.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the remember me functionality securely? Storing a token in cookies and hashing it in the database seems better than storing plain text. Oh, right, but I should set expiration dates on the cookies so they don't last forever.\n\nI also need to return something to indicate success or failure. Maybe an array with status, message, and user data if successful. Or maybe just a boolean? But providing more info could help in handling responses on the front end.\n\nOh, and error handling! What if the database connection fails or the query has an error? I should include try-catch blocks or check for errors after each mysqli function call. Maybe adding some logging would be helpful too, but that's beyond this basic function.\n\nWait, in the initial code, I used $conn->prepare and bind_param correctly. That should prevent SQL injection. Also, using password_verify ensures that even if someone gets the hashed passwords, they can't reverse engineer them easily.\n\nI think I covered the main points: connecting to the database, preparing a safe query, checking credentials, handling sessions, remember me functionality with tokens, and returning appropriate responses. Now, putting it all together in code.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user login function using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Include configuration file\ninclude 'config.php';\n\nfunction user_login($username, $password) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    try {\n        // Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id, username, password FROM users WHERE username = ?\");\n        $stmt->bind_param('s', $username);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        \n        // Get the result\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n        \n        if ($result->num_rows === 0) {\n            return array(\n                'status' => false,\n                'message' => \"Username not found.\"\n            );\n        }\n\n        // Fetch the user data\n        $user = $result->fetch_assoc();\n\n        // Verify password\n        if (!password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {\n            return array(\n                'status' => false,\n                'message' => \"Incorrect password.\"\n            );\n        }\n\n        // Start a session\n        session_start();\n        \n        // Store user data in the session\n        $_SESSION['username'] = $username;\n        $_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];\n        \n        // Track login attempts\n        $_SESSION['last_login_time'] = time();\n        $_SESSION['login_count'] = isset($_SESSION['login_count']) ? $_SESSION['login_count'] + 1 : 1;\n\n        // Optional: Set a cookie for \"Remember Me\" functionality\n        if (isset($_POST['remember'])) {\n            $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));\n            \n            // Store token in the database\n            $stmt_token = $conn->prepare(\"UPDATE users SET remember_token = ? WHERE id = ?\");\n            $stmt_token->bind_param('si', $token, $user['id']);\n            $stmt_token->execute();\n            \n            setcookie('remember_token', $token, time() + 3600 * 24 * 7); // Expires after 1 week\n        }\n\n        return array(\n            'status' => true,\n            'message' => \"Login successful!\",\n            'user' => $user\n        );\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        return array(\n            'status' => false,\n            'message' => \"An error occurred: \" . $e->getMessage()\n        );\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes several security features:\n\n1. **Prepared Statements**: To prevent SQL injection.\n\n2. **Password Hashing**: Uses PHP's `password_verify()` to check hashed passwords stored in the database.\n\n3. **Session Management**: Stores user data in a session after successful login.\n\n4. **Remember Me Feature**: Allows users to stay logged in by setting a cookie with a random token.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Catches exceptions and returns appropriate error messages.\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Create a `config.php` file that contains your database connection details.\n\n2. Ensure you have a table named `users` with the following columns:\n   - id (integer, primary key)\n   - username (string)\n   - password (string) - should be hashed using `password_hash()`\n   - remember_token (string)\n\n3. In your login form, include a checkbox for \"Remember Me\".\n\n4. Call this function when processing the login form submission.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```php\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n    $password = $_POST['password'];\n\n    $login_result = user_login($username, $password);\n\n    if ($login_result['status']) {\n        // Redirect to dashboard or home page\n        header('Location: dashboard.php');\n        exit;\n    } else {\n        echo $login_result['message'];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- Make sure to use HTTPS in production environments.\n- Regularly update and maintain your application for security patches.\n- Consider implementing additional security measures like CAPTCHA, rate limiting, or multi-factor authentication depending on your needs.\n\nRemember that this is a basic example and you should customize it according to your specific requirements.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Include configuration file\ninclude 'config.php';\n\nfunction user_login($username, $password) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    try {\n        // Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id, username, password FROM users WHERE username = ?\");\n        $stmt->bind_param('s', $username);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        \n        // Get the result\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n        \n        if ($result->num_rows === 0) {\n            return array(\n                'status' => false,\n                'message' => \"Username not found.\"\n            );\n        }\n\n        // Fetch the user data\n        $user = $result->fetch_assoc();\n\n        // Verify password\n        if (!password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {\n            return array(\n                'status' => false,\n                'message' => \"Incorrect password.\"\n            );\n        }\n\n        // Start a session\n        session_start();\n        \n        // Store user data in the session\n        $_SESSION['username'] = $username;\n        $_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];\n        \n        // Track login attempts\n        $_SESSION['last_login_time'] = time();\n        $_SESSION['login_count'] = isset($_SESSION['login_count']) ? $_SESSION['login_count'] + 1 : 1;\n\n        // Optional: Set a cookie for \"Remember Me\" functionality\n        if (isset($_POST['remember'])) {\n            $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));\n            \n            // Store token in the database\n            $stmt_token = $conn->prepare(\"UPDATE users SET remember_token = ?

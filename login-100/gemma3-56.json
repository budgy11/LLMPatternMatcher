If an error occurs, `die()` terminates the script and displays an error message.\n   - **SQL Query:**\n     - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'`: This SQL query searches the `users` table for a row where the `username` and `password` fields match the values entered by the user.  **Important Security Note:** Using string concatenation to build SQL queries like this is highly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  See the \"Security Considerations\" section below for how to prevent this.\n   - **`$result = $conn->query($sql)`:** Executes the SQL query and stores the result.\n   - **`$result->num_rows == 1`:** Checks if the query returned exactly one row.  If it did, it means a user with the entered credentials exists in the database.\n   - **`$row = $result->fetch_assoc();`:** If a user is found, this fetches the data from the first row of the result set as an associative array.\n   - **`$_SESSION[\"user_id\"] = $row[\"id\"];` and  `$_SESSION[\"username\"] = $row[\"username\"];`:**  These lines set session variables to store the user's ID and username.  Session variables allow you to keep track of the user's identity across multiple pages without requiring them to re-enter their credentials on every page.\n   - **`header(\"Location: secure_page.php\");`:** Redirects the user to a secure page (e.g., a dashboard or admin panel). Replace `secure_page.php` with the actual URL.\n   - **`exit();`:** Stops further script execution after the redirection.\n   - **`$error = \"Invalid username or password.\";`:** If the user is not found, an error message is stored in the `$error` variable.\n\n3. **HTML Form:**\n   - The HTML form includes input fields for username and password, a submit button, and a `method=\"POST\"` attribute to send the form data to `login.php`.\n   - The `required` attribute on the input fields ensures that the user must enter a value in each field before submitting the form.\n   -  The `<?php if (isset($error)) { ?> ... <?php } ?>` block displays the error message if an error occurred.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Create a `users` Table:**  You'll need to create a `users` table in your database.  A basic table structure would look like this:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE users (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       email VARCHAR(255)\n   );\n   ```\n   (Adjust data types as needed.)  Make sure to include a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `username` column to prevent duplicate usernames.\n\n2. **Populate the Table:** Add some test user accounts to the `users` table.  **Use strong passwords!**  Don't use the same password for all test accounts.\n\n3. **Place Files:** Save the PHP code as `login.php` and the HTML code as `login.html` (or a similar name). Make sure they are in the same directory (or a subdirectory) on your web server.\n\n4. **Run the Code:** Access the `login.html` file through your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/login.html`).\n\n**Security Considerations (VERY IMPORTANT):**\n\n* **SQL Injection Prevention:** The most critical security issue in this code is the use of string concatenation to build the SQL query.  This is extremely vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  **Never** build SQL queries using string concatenation with user-supplied data.  Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent this.  Here's an example using prepared statements:\n\n   ```php\n   <?php\n   // ... (Database connection code) ...\n\n   if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n     $username = $_POST[\"username\"];\n     $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n\n     $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\");\n     $stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $username, $password); // \"ss\" indicates that both arguments are strings\n     $stmt->execute();\n     $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n     if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n       // ... (User found, set session variables) ...\n     } else {\n       $error = \"Invalid username or password.\";\n     }\n\n     $stmt->close();\n   }\n   ?>\n   ```\n\n   The `prepare()` method prepares the SQL query for execution, and `bind_param()` securely binds the user-supplied data to the query.  This prevents malicious SQL code from being injected into the query.\n\n* **Password Storage:**  **Never** store passwords in plain text in your database.  Instead, store them as *hashed* passwords using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.  These algorithms produce a one-way hash of the password, which makes it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the password from the hash.\n\n   Example using `password_hash()`:\n\n   ```php\n   // When creating a new user:\n   $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n   $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   $sql = \"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('$username', '$hashed_password')\";\n   // ... execute the query ...\n   ```\n\n   When the user attempts to log in, you would retrieve the hashed password from the database and use `password_verify()` to compare it with the entered password:\n\n   ```php\n   // In the login process:\n   $hashed_password = $row[\"password\"];\n   if (password_verify($password, $hashed_password)) {\n     // User is authenticated\n   } else {\n     // Invalid password\n   }\n   ```\n\n* **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent various vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.\n\n* **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your web server, protecting the username and password during transmission.\n\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  This limits the number of login attempts allowed within a certain time period.\n\n* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent sensitive information from being displayed to the user.  Log errors for debugging purposes, but don't display them to the user.\n\n* **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review your code and security practices to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nBy following these security considerations, you can significantly reduce the risk of your login function being compromised.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should always stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database credentials (Replace with your actual credentials)\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n\n  // Get the username and password from the form\n  $username = $_POST[\"username\"];\n  $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n\n  // Connect to the database\n  $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n  // Check connection\n  if ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n  }\n\n  // SQL query to authenticate the user\n  $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'\";\n\n  $result = $conn->query($sql);\n\n  if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n    // User found, set session variables for authentication\n    $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n    $_SESSION[\"user_id\"] = $row[\"id\"];\n    $_SESSION[\"username\"] = $row[\"username\"];\n    // You might want to store other user information here if needed\n    \n    // Redirect to a secure page\n    header(\"Location: secure_page.php\"); // Replace 'secure_page.php' with the appropriate URL\n    exit();\n  } else {\n    // User not found\n    $error = \"Invalid username or password.\";\n  }\n}\n?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Login</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <h2>Login</h2>\n\n  <form action=\"login.php\" method=\"POST\">\n    Username: <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" required><br><br>\n    Password: <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" required><br><br>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\">\n  </form>\n\n  <?php if (isset($error)) { ?>\n    <p style=\"color: red;\"><?php echo $error; ?></p>\n  <?php } ?>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```"]}

This function *hashes* the password entered by the user and compares it to the *hashed* password stored in the database.  This is the correct way to verify passwords.\n    * **`password_hash()` (Not in this example, but important to know):**  When a *new* user registers, you should use `password_hash()` to hash the password *before* storing it in the database.  The `password_verify()` function will automatically use the hashed version when verifying.\n    * **Input Validation:**  The `empty()` checks ensure that the username and password fields are not empty. This prevents attempts to submit empty forms, which could cause errors or, in a less secure implementation, could be exploited.\n    * **Prepared Statements (Important - but not implemented here for clarity):** For maximum security, you should use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is beyond the scope of a simple login example, but it is the best practice.\n* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes a robust error handling system:\n    * **Error Array:**  An `$error` array is used to collect and display any errors that occur during the login process.\n    * **Error Display:** The errors are displayed as an unordered list (`<ul>`) for better readability.\n* **Database Connection:** The code includes the necessary steps to establish a connection to the database using `mysqli`.  You will need to replace the placeholder values (`your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database`) with your actual database credentials.\n* **Form Handling:**  The `if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\")` block ensures that the code only executes when the form has been submitted.\n* **Session Management:**  `session_start()` is called to start the session.  Then, `$_SESSION[\"username\"]` is set to store the username in the session.  This is important because it allows you to identify the user after they have logged in, so you don't have to re-enter their credentials on every page.  Storing the user ID as well is common for further security and efficient operations.\n* **Redirection:**  `header(\"Location: welcome.php\");` redirects the user to a `welcome.php` page after a successful login.  This is a standard practice and prevents the user from seeing the login form again. `exit();` is called to immediately terminate the script after the redirect, ensuring the redirection happens.\n* **Clearer Code Structure and Comments:** The code is formatted with comments to make it easier to understand and maintain.\n* **`required` Attribute:**  The `required` attribute is added to the input fields in the HTML form, making it clear to the user that these fields are mandatory.\n\n**How to Use This Code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:** Create a MySQL database and a table named `users`.  The table should have at least two columns: `username` (VARCHAR or TEXT) and `password` (VARCHAR or TEXT).  Add an `id` column, typically an INT, as the primary key.  Populate the table with some test user data.\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE users (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       password TEXT NOT NULL\n   );\n   ```\n   Then, hash the passwords before inserting them into the database.  A good hashing algorithm to use is `password_hash()` in PHP.  Don't store passwords in plain text.\n\n2. **Replace Placeholders:**  Update the `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` variables with your actual database credentials.\n\n3. **Create `welcome.php`:**  Create a file named `welcome.php` (or whatever you want to name it) and put your code in there. This page should display a welcome message to the user.  You could, for example:\n   ```php\n   <?php\n   if (isset($_SESSION[\"username\"])) {\n       echo \"<h1>Welcome, \" . $_SESSION[\"username\"] . \"!</h1>\";\n       echo \"<p>You are logged in.</p>\";\n   } else {\n       echo \"<p>You are not logged in.</p>\";\n   }\n   ?>\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Code:**  Save the login code as a `.php` file (e.g., `login.php`) and access it through your web server.\n\nImportant Considerations and Next Steps:\n\n* **SQL Injection:**  For production environments, *always* use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a critical security measure.\n* **Password Storage:**  Use `password_hash()` to generate a strong, salted hash of the user's password *before* storing it in the database.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **Error Logging:**  Log errors to a file or database for debugging and monitoring.\n* **User Interface:**  Improve the user interface of the login form.\n* **Security Audits:**  Regularly conduct security audits of your code.\n\nThis comprehensive example provides a solid foundation for creating a secure and functional login system in PHP.

This *stops* the rest of the script from executing *after* the login is successful.  Without this, the browser might try to read the rest of the form fields (potentially exposing the password in the URL) even after the login is complete.\n    * **Basic Input Validation:**  Added `filter_var()` to validate that the username is an email address.  Also uses a regular expression to ensure it only contains alphanumeric characters. *This is a very basic level of validation*.  You *must* add more robust validation in a real-world application (see \"Important Security Considerations\" below).\n    * **Prepared Statements (Important - NOT Implemented Here for Simplicity):** For production code, *always* use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  I haven't implemented them here to keep the example simple, but you should absolutely use them.  PHP's `mysqli_stmt` interface is used for this.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  The code now checks for empty input and displays an error message if the login fails.  The error message is displayed on the page.\n\n* **`$_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]`:**  The `action` attribute of the form is set to `$_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]`, which means the form data will be submitted back to the same PHP script.\n\n* **Clearer Code Structure:** The code is more clearly structured with comments to explain the different sections.\n\n* **Session Management:**  The code sets the `username` in the `$_SESSION` array. This is how you would typically store user information after a successful login.\n\n* **Security Notes / Important Security Considerations (Extremely Important):**\n    * **NEVER store passwords directly.** This example shows the password as a plain text string for simplicity *only*.  In a real application, you *must* hash the password using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.  PHP's `password_hash()` function can handle this.  Store the *hash* of the password, not the password itself.\n    * **Input Validation is Critical:** The provided input validation is *very* basic.  You *must* implement more thorough input validation, including:\n        * **Length Restrictions:** Set minimum and maximum lengths for username and password fields.\n        * **Character Restrictions:**  More restrictive rules for allowed characters (e.g., no special characters).\n        * **Blacklisting:**  Consider blacklisting specific patterns that could be used for attacks.\n    * **CSRF Protection:**  Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent attackers from forging login requests. This involves using a unique, unpredictable token for each form submission.\n    * **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.\n    * **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n    * **Password Complexity:** Enforce password complexity rules (e.g., minimum length, required character types).\n\nHow to Use:\n\n1.  **Create a Database:**  Create a MySQL database and a table named `users` with columns like `id`, `username`, and `password`.  (The `id` column should be an auto-incrementing primary key).\n2.  **Database Credentials:** Replace the placeholder values for `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` with your actual database credentials.\n3.  **Populate the Database:** Insert some sample user data into the `users` table.\n4.  **Run the Script:**  Place the PHP code in a file (e.g., `login.php`) and run it from your web browser.\n\nRemember to prioritize security in your application. The example provided is a starting point, but you *must* adapt it to your specific needs and implement robust security measures.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details - Replace with your actual details!\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Get the login data from the form\n    $username = $_POST[\"username\"];\n    $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n\n    // Validate the input (basic - you should enhance this!)\n    if (empty($username) || empty($password)) {\n        $error = \"Username and password cannot be empty.\";\n    } elseif (!filter_var($username, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL) && !preg_match(\"/^[_a-z0-9]+$/i\", $username)) {\n        $error = \"Invalid username.

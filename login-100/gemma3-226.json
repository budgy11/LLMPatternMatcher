Storing passwords in plain text is a huge security risk.  This code uses `password_hash()` (not included in the example but highly recommended) *during registration* to create a *hashed* representation of the password.  Then, `password_verify()` is used during login to compare the entered password with the stored hash.  This is the *correct* way to handle passwords.  The example now correctly retrieves the password *from the database*, but it does *not* store the plain text password.\n* **Prepared Statements:** The `prepare()` and `bind_param()` functions are used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is a crucial security measure.  This method separates the SQL code from user input, making it much more difficult for attackers to insert malicious code.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes `connect_error` check and basic error handling for query execution.\n* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names like `$hashed_password`.\n* **`exit()`:**  Added `exit()` after the `header()` call to prevent the rest of the script from executing if login is successful.\n* **HTML Form:**  Includes a basic HTML form to demonstrate how the login function would be used in a real application.\n* **Comments and Explanations:** Added comments to explain each part of the code.\n* **`$_SESSION`:** The code now correctly uses `$_SESSION` to store the user ID and username after a successful login.  This is the standard way to keep track of a user's identity on a website.\n* **Redirect:**  The code includes a `header(\"Location: protected_page.php\");` to redirect the user to a protected page after successful login.\n* **No Plain Text Password Storage:** The example code emphasizes that you should *never* store the password in plain text.\n\n\n**How to Use this Code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   - Create a database (e.g., \"your_database_name\").\n   - Create a table named \"users\" with columns:\n     - `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n     - `username` (VARCHAR)\n     - `password` (VARCHAR)  *Important: store the hashed password here*\n\n   - Insert some sample user data, including hashed passwords.\n\n2. **Replace Placeholders:**\n   - Change the `$db_host`, `$db_username`, `$db_password`, and `$db_name` variables to match your database credentials.\n\n3. **Hashing Passwords During Registration (Critical):**\n   -  When a user registers, you *must* hash their password using `password_hash()`.  Here's an example:\n     ```php\n     $password = $_POST['password'];\n     $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n     // Store $hashed_password in the database.\n     ```\n\n4. **Integrate into your Application:**\n   -  Implement the HTML form (or your existing form).\n   -  On form submission, call the `loginUser()` function, passing the username and password entered by the user.\n   -  If the login is successful, redirect the user to a protected page.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.  This protects the password during transmission.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection (even with prepared statements, be careful about user-supplied input).\n* **Regularly Update:** Keep your PHP version and any libraries you are using up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n* **Store Sensitive Information Securely:**  Be extremely careful about how you store and manage sensitive information like passwords.  Use strong encryption, and follow best practices for security.\n* **Consider a Framework:**  If you're building a more complex web application, using a PHP framework (like Laravel or Symfony) can significantly improve security by providing built-in security features and best practices.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and robust solution for handling user logins.  It addresses the critical security flaws of the previous version and incorporates best practices for web application development. Remember to always prioritize security when handling user credentials.  This example is a starting point; you'll need to adapt it to your specific application needs.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database configuration (Replace with your actual credentials)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_username = \"your_username\";\n$db_password = \"your_password\";\n$db_name = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Function to handle user login\nfunction loginUser($username, $password) {\n  // Connect to the database\n  $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_username, $db_password, $db_name);\n\n  // Check connection\n  if ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n  }\n\n  // Prepare the SQL query\n  $sql = \"SELECT id, username, password FROM users WHERE username = ?;\";\n\n  // Use prepared statement to prevent SQL injection\n  $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n  $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $username);  // \"s\" indicates a string parameter\n\n  // Execute the query\n  if ($stmt->execute() === TRUE) {\n    // Get the result\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n      $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n      $hashed_password = $row['password']; // Retrieve the hashed password\n\n      // Verify the password (Crucially, compare with the *hashed* password)\n      if (password_verify($password, $hashed_password)) {\n        // Login successful\n        $_SESSION[\"user_id\"] = $row[\"id\"];\n        $_SESSION[\"username\"] = $row[\"username\"];\n        return true;\n      } else {\n        // Incorrect password\n        return false;\n      }\n    } else {\n      // No user found with that username\n      return false;\n    }\n\n  } else {\n    // Query error\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Close the statement and connection\n  $stmt->close();\n  $conn->close();\n}\n\n// Example usage (simplified - you'll likely want to have a form and handle the form submission)\nif (isset($_POST['username']) && isset($_POST['password'])) {\n  $username = $_POST['username'];\n  $password = $_POST['password'];\n\n  if (loginUser($username, $password)) {\n    echo \"Login successful!

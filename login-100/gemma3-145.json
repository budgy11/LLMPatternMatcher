This completely prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Don't use string concatenation or `mysqli_query()` directly with user input.\n* **Password Hashing (Critical):**\n    * **NEVER STORE PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT!**  The code now includes a placeholder for how to properly hash passwords using `password_hash()` when creating the user account *and* `password_verify()` for verification during login.  I've added a very important comment explicitly stating this.  You will need to implement password hashing when a new user registers.  This is crucial for security.\n* **`mysqli_stmt` (Statement Object):**  Using a statement object (`mysqli_stmt`) is best practice for prepared statements.\n* **`bind_param()`:**  The `bind_param(\"s\", $username)` function tells the database driver how to bind the parameter to the statement. `\"s\"` indicates a string parameter.\n* **`get_result()`:**  Gets the result set from the statement, allowing you to iterate through the results if needed.\n* **Error Handling:** The `if ($conn->connect_error)` block provides basic error handling if the database connection fails.  You should enhance this in a production environment.\n* **`session_start()` and `session_destroy()`:** The code demonstrates how to use PHP sessions to maintain user login status.\n* **`header(\"Location: secure_page.php\");`**:  This line redirects the user to a secure page after successful login. *Replace `secure_page.php` with the actual URL.*\n* **`exit();`**:  Essential to stop further script execution after a redirect.\n* **Clearer Comments:** Added more detailed comments explaining each step.\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Change the following variables to your actual values:\n   - `$host`: Database host (usually \"localhost\")\n   - `$username`: Database username\n   - `$password`: Database password\n   - `$database`: Database name\n   - `secure_page.php`:  The URL of your secure page.\n\n2. **Password Hashing (Registration -  You MUST implement this):**\n   - When a user registers, *before* storing the password in the database, you *must* hash it:\n\n     ```php\n     $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n     $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);  // Use PASSWORD_DEFAULT for the best hashing algorithm.\n\n     // Then, store $hashed_password in the database.\n     ```\n\n3. **Password Verification (Login -  See the code above)**\n\n4. **Create `secure_page.php`:**  This page will display content to authenticated users. It doesn't need to do anything complicated at this point, but it's the page the user is redirected to after logging in.\n\n5. **Testing:**\n   - **Important:**  For development and testing, you can temporarily disable security measures (like input validation and error handling) to quickly test the login functionality.  *Never* do this in a production environment.\n   - Use a tool like Postman to send HTTP POST requests with the username and password to the login script.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Beyond the Code):**\n\n* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While the prepared statement prevents SQL injection, you *still* need to validate and sanitize user input on the server-side to prevent other vulnerabilities, such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).\n* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server, protecting user credentials during transmission.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **Error Handling:**  Enhance error handling to provide more informative messages to the user and log errors for debugging.\n* **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review your code and security practices.\n\nThis improved response provides a secure and robust user login function, incorporating the critical security measures needed to protect your application.  Remember to implement the password hashing and other security best practices outlined above.  It also includes thorough explanations and important considerations for building a secure web application.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database credentials - REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL CREDENTIALS!\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$database = \"your_database\";\n\n// Form data\n$username = $_POST[\"username\"];\n$password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n\n// 1.

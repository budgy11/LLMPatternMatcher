The example *shows* the vulnerable approach for demonstration purposes only.  **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements)** to protect against SQL injection.  The mysqli extension supports prepared statements.\n\n4. **Prepared Statements (Recommended - Security!)**\n   To use prepared statements, you'd rewrite the query like this:\n\n   ```php\n   $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\");\n   $stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $username, $password); // \"ss\" indicates two string parameters\n   $stmt->execute();\n   $result = $stmt->get_result();\n   ```\n\n   This is the *correct* and recommended approach.  The `bind_param()` function safely handles the input, preventing SQL injection.\n\n5. **Authentication:**\n   - `if ($result->num_rows > 0)`: This checks if any rows were returned by the query. If rows were returned, it means a user with the given username and password exists.\n   - `$user_data = $result->fetch_assoc()`:  Retrieves the user data as an associative array.\n\n6. **Session Management:**\n   - `session_start()`: Starts the PHP session, which is essential for tracking the user's login status.\n   - `$_SESSION['username'] = $username;`: Stores the username in the session.\n   - `$_SESSION['user_id'] = $user_data['id'];`:  Stores the user's ID (if you have one) in the session.  Adjust this based on your table structure.\n\n7. **Redirection:**\n   - `header(\"Location: protected_page.php\");`:  Sends the user to a protected page after successful login.  The `protected_page.php` should be a page that requires authentication.\n   - `exit();`:  Stops further execution of the current script.  This is important because if you don't `exit()`, the script will continue to try to execute the code that depends on the session being set, which will cause errors.\n\n8. **Error Handling:**\n   - `echo \"Invalid username or password.\";`: Displays an error message if the user's credentials are incorrect.\n\n9. **Closing the Connection:**\n   - ` $conn->close();`:  Closes the database connection to free up resources.\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Create a Login Form:**  Create an HTML form that allows the user to enter their username and password.  Submit the form to this PHP script.\n\n   ```html\n   <form action=\"login.php\" method=\"post\">\n     <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n     <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\">\n     <br>\n     <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n     <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\">\n     <br>\n     <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a `users` Table:**  Make sure you have a table named `users` in your MySQL database with at least columns for `username` and `password` (and potentially an `id` column).\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE users (\n     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n     username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n     password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n     -- other columns\n   );\n   ```\n\n3. **Database Setup:** Ensure that the database connection details (server name, username, password, database name) are correct.\n\n4. **Security Best Practices:**\n    - **Hashing Passwords:**  *Never* store passwords in plain text in your database.  Use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) to store a *hash* of the password.  You'll need to use a PHP extension (like `password_hash()`) to generate the hash and `password_verify()` to compare the entered password with the hash.\n    - **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate the user input on the server-side to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n    - **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n    - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your application.\n\n**Important Security Reminders:**\n\n* **Prepared Statements (SQL Injection Prevention):** *Always* use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. The example code intentionally uses the vulnerable approach for illustration only.  The use of prepared statements is critical for security.\n* **Password Hashing:** Implement password hashing to store passwords securely.\n* **HTTPS:**  Ensure your website uses HTTPS.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides the code, a detailed explanation, and crucial security considerations.

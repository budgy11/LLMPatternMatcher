This is *essential* to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Prepared statements handle the parameterization safely, ensuring data is treated as data, not as part of the SQL query itself.  *Never* directly concatenate user input into your SQL queries.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes `die()` for connection errors and `echo` for query errors, providing helpful information for debugging.\n* **Clearer Error Messages:** Better error messages are displayed to the user.\n* **`exit()` After Redirect:**  `exit();` is called after the `header(\"Location: ...\")`. This is critically important. Without it, the rest of the script might execute, leading to potential security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. `exit()` terminates the current script execution.\n* **Session Management:**  Uses `$_SESSION` to store the user's ID and username after successful login. This allows you to maintain the user's logged-in state across multiple pages.\n* **Redirect:**  Redirects the user to a secure page (e.g., a dashboard) after login.\n* **`$result->num_rows` Check**:  Ensures the query returned exactly one row (the user), preventing errors if the username doesn't exist.\n* **Closing Statements and Connections**:  Properly closes the database statement and connection using `$stmt->close()` and `$conn->close()`. This is good practice for resource management.\n* **Comments:** Added comments to explain each step of the process.\n* **Best Practices:** The code adheres to common PHP coding standards.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1.  **Database Setup:**\n    *   Create a MySQL database.\n    *   Create a `users` table with at least `id` (INT, primary key), `username` (VARCHAR), and `password` (VARCHAR) columns.\n    *   Insert some sample user data into the `users` table (e.g., username: `testuser`, password: `password123`).  *Use strong passwords in a production environment.*\n\n2.  **Save the PHP Code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `login.php`).\n\n3.  **Create a Form:** Create an HTML form (e.g., `login_form.html`) to capture the username and password:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Login</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <form action=\"login.php\" method=\"post\">\n    <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" required><br><br>\n\n    <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n    <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" required><br><br>\n\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\">\n  </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n4.  **Include the Form in Your Page:**  Place the `login_form.html` form within your `login.php` file (or link it from a main page).\n\n5.  **Run the Login Page:**  Access the `login.php` file in your web browser.  Enter a valid username and password to log in.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n*   **Password Hashing:** *Never* store passwords in plain text in your database. Always use a strong password hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.  PHP's `password_hash()` function is designed for this purpose.  Example:\n\n    ```php\n    $password = $_POST['password'];\n    $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n    // Then, store $hashed_password in the database.\n    ```\n\n*   **Input Validation:**  Validate the username and password on the server-side (as shown in this example).  Don't rely solely on client-side validation (JavaScript) because it can be easily bypassed.  Check for valid character sets, maximum lengths, and ensure the data is actually a password.\n\n*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\n*   **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n\n*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review your code and security practices.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a robust, secure, and well-documented login function, along with critical security advice.

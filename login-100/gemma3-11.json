Use a strong hashing algorithm like `password_hash()`:\n    ```php\n    // During user registration:\n    $password = $_POST['password'];\n    $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n    // Then store $hashed_password in the database\n    ```\n* **`password_verify()`:** This function is designed to compare a plaintext password with a hashed password, returning `true` if they match.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes a basic check for database connection errors.  More robust error handling would involve logging errors and providing more user-friendly messages.\n* **Session Management:**\n    * `session_start();`  Starts a PHP session. Sessions allow you to maintain user state across multiple requests.\n    * `$_SESSION['user_id'] = $row['id'];` and `$_SESSION['username'] = $username;` Store the user's ID and username in the session. This lets you identify the user on subsequent pages.\n* **Clearer Logic and Comments:** The code is well-commented and has a more logical flow.\n* **Input Validation (Important - not implemented here for brevity):**  **Crucially, you *must* add input validation to your login form to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).**  This involves validating:\n    * The username and password fields against expected formats and lengths.\n    * Preventing special characters from being submitted (which could be used in SQL injection).\n    * Consider using prepared statements (using PDO or MySQLi) for even stronger protection.\n* **`exit()` after redirects:**  Ensures that the script stops executing after redirecting to prevent any further code from running, which could lead to unexpected behavior.\n* **Secure Page:** The `header(\"Location: secured_page.php\");` directs the user to a secure page once they have successfully logged in.\n* **`login_form.php`:**  This script should contain the HTML form to collect the username and password.  You need to create this file.\n* **Database Structure (important):**  This assumes a basic `users` table with columns `id`, `username`, and `password`.  Your database structure may be different.\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Create the `users` table:**  Make sure your database has a `users` table with the specified columns.\n2. **Register users:**  Implement user registration functionality.  During registration, use `password_hash()` to store a *hashed* password in the `password` column.\n3. **Create `login_form.php`:** Create an HTML form to collect the username and password.  This form should have the following input fields:\n   ```html\n   <form action=\"login.php\" method=\"post\">\n     <label for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n     <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" required><br><br>\n\n     <label for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n     <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" name=\"password\" required><br><br>\n\n     <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n   </form>\n   ```\n4. **Place the PHP code:** Save the PHP code as `login.php` in your web server's document root.\n5. **Adjust Database Credentials:**  Replace `\"your_username\"`, `\"your_password\"`, and `\"your_database\"` with your actual database credentials.\n6. **Secure `secured_page.php`:** Create a `secured_page.php` (or whatever you named it) to redirect to after successful login.  This page should be protected, so only logged-in users can access it.\n\n**Example `secured_page.php`**\n\n```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\nif (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {\n    header(\"Location: login_form.php\");\n    exit();\n}\n\necho \"<h1>Welcome, \" . $_SESSION['username'] . \"</h1>\";\necho \"<p>You are logged in as user ID: \" . $_SESSION['user_id'] . \"</p>\";\n// Add your secure content here\necho \"<a href='logout.php'>Logout</a>\";\n?>\n```\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **SQL Injection:**  Using prepared statements (with PDO or MySQLi) is *essential* to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is the most critical security measure.\n* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Implement proper output escaping to prevent XSS attacks.\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the user's browser and your server.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **Regularly Update Software:** Keep your PHP version and all libraries up to date with the latest security patches.\n* **Password Complexity:**  Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, required characters).\n* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Consider adding 2FA for increased security.\n\nThis comprehensive example provides a solid foundation for building a secure login system.  Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices.  Always test your login system thoroughly to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual credentials)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$database = \"your_database\";\n\n// Form data (from the login form)\n$username = $_POST['username'];\n$password = $_POST['password'];\n\n// Check if the form was submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n\n  // Connect to the database\n  $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n  // Check connection\n  if ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n  }\n\n  // SQL query to check credentials\n  $sql = \"SELECT id, username, password FROM users WHERE username = '$username'\";\n  $result = $conn->query($sql);\n\n  // Check if the username exists\n  if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n    $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n    $hashed_password = $row['password']; // Retrieve the hashed password\n\n    // Compare the entered password with the stored hashed password\n    if (password_verify($password, $hashed_password)) {\n      // Password matches!

{"prompt": "Create a search bar using php", "llm_output": "To create a simple search bar using PHP, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Connect to your database.\n2. Create an HTML form with a text input field for the user's search query.\n3. Handle the form submission by processing the user's search query.\n4. Use SQL queries or prepared statements to execute a search based on the user's input.\n\nHere is a basic example of how you could implement this:\n\n### Step 1: Database Connection\n\nFirst, make sure your database connection settings are correct in your PHP script. For simplicity, let's assume we're using MySQL with the `mysqli` extension or PDO for better security and functionality.\n\n```php\n<?php\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Alternatively with PDO (more secure and powerful)\n// PDO connection code is also possible here\n?>\n```\n\n### Step 2: HTML Form\n\nNext, create an HTML form to get the user's search query. This will be submitted to your PHP script for processing.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Search Bar</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<form action=\"search.php\" method=\"GET\">\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"search-input\" name=\"searchTerm\" placeholder=\"Enter your search term...\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n</form>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 3: PHP Search Handling\n\nCreate a script named `search.php` (or any name you choose) in the same directory as your form. This script will handle the user's search query.\n\n```php\n<?php\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"GET\") {\n    $searchTerm = $_GET['searchTerm'];\n\n    // SQL Query with Prepared Statement (PDO)\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE :term\");\n    $stmt->bindParam(':term', $searchTerm . '%');\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $results = $stmt->fetchAll();\n\n    // Display results\n    echo \"<h2>Search Results:</h2>\";\n    foreach ($results as $row) {\n        echo $row['column_name'] . \"<br>\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"Invalid request method. Only GET is supported.\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Make sure to replace `'table_name'`, `'column_name'` with your actual database table and column names.\n- This is a basic example for educational purposes. Real-world applications should include error handling, sanitization of user input, and possibly more robust security measures depending on the project's requirements.\n\nThis example uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) which is considered safer than `mysqli`. However, you can adapt this example to use `mysqli` if that's what your project requires.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Alternatively with PDO (more secure and powerful)\n// PDO connection code is also possible here\n?>\n```", null, "```php\n<?php\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"GET\") {\n    $searchTerm = $_GET['searchTerm'];\n\n    // SQL Query with Prepared Statement (PDO)\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE :term\");\n    $stmt->bindParam(':term', $searchTerm .

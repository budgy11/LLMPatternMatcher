{"prompt": "Create a search bar using php", "llm_output": "To create a simple search bar using PHP, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Get the Search Query from User**: We need to get the user's input (the query they want to search for) and store it in a variable.\n2. **Connect to Database or API**: Since our focus is on the client-side handling of the query before sending it to a server, we'll assume you're interacting with a database. PHP can connect to many databases such as MySQL. We will use an example that simulates searching against a hypothetical database or directly in PHP arrays for simplicity.\n3. **Process Search Query**: Process the query by checking if it's empty and doing any necessary sanitization.\n\nHere is a basic example of how you might do this:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Assuming $db is your connection to a MySQL database\n\n// Get search input from user\n$searchQuery = $_GET['search'];\nif (empty($searchQuery)) {\n    echo \"Please enter something to search for.\";\n} else {\n    // Remove leading and trailing spaces, convert to lower case for simplicity\n    $searchQuery = trim(strtolower($searchQuery));\n\n    // Process your query here. For example, if you were searching against a database,\n    // you'd use SQL queries.\n    // For the sake of simplicity, let's just echo out results from an array.\n    $resultsArray = [\n        ['title' => 'Result 1', 'description' => 'Some description'],\n        ['title' => 'Result 2', 'description' => 'Another description']\n    ];\n\n    foreach ($resultsArray as $result) {\n        if (strpos(strtolower($result['title']), $searchQuery) !== false || \n            strpos(strtolower($result['description']), $searchQuery) !== false) {\n            echo $result['title'] . \" - \" . $result['description'];\n        }\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis example uses `$_GET` to get the search query from the URL. However, in real-world applications, consider using `POST` method for form data, especially when dealing with user input.\n\nFor a full-fledged implementation that includes HTML for the search bar and form submission handling, you would typically have something like:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"search.php\" method=\"get\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search here...\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n</form>\n\n<?php include 'search_process.php'; ?>\n```\n\nNote that in a real application, you would want to handle form submissions securely (e.g., validating and sanitizing user input), protecting against SQL injection by using prepared statements or parameterized queries if interacting with a database.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Assuming $db is your connection to a MySQL database\n\n// Get search input from user\n$searchQuery = $_GET['search'];\nif (empty($searchQuery)) {\n    echo \"Please enter something to search for.\";\n} else {\n    // Remove leading and trailing spaces, convert to lower case for simplicity\n    $searchQuery = trim(strtolower($searchQuery));\n\n    // Process your query here.

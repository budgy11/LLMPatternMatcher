{"prompt": "Create a search bar using php", "llm_output": "Here's an example of how you can create a simple search bar using PHP. In this example, we'll use HTML for the form and PHP to process the query.\n\n**index.php**\n```php\n<?php\n// Include the header file (optional)\ninclude 'header.php';\n?>\n\n<!-- Form to input the search query -->\n<form action=\"\" method=\"post\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"search_query\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\n    <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n</form>\n\n<?php\n// Check if form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    // Get the search query from the POST array\n    $search_query = $_POST['search_query'];\n\n    // Process the search query (e.g., query a database)\n    // For this example, we'll just display the search query\n    echo '<h2>Search Results:</h2>';\n    echo '<p>Searching for: ' . $search_query . '</p>';\n\n    // You can replace this with your actual search logic\n    // e.g., querying a database using PDO or MySQLi\n}\n?>\n\n<?php\n// Include the footer file (optional)\ninclude 'footer.php';\n?>\n```\n**How it works**\n\n1. The form is created using HTML, with an `input` field for the search query and a submit button.\n2. When the form is submitted (e.g., when the user clicks the \"Search\" button), the PHP script checks if the request method is `POST`, which indicates that the form has been submitted.\n3. If the form has been submitted, the script gets the search query from the `$_POST` array and stores it in a variable called `$search_query`.\n4. The script then processes the search query (e.g., queries a database). For this example, we'll just display the search query on the page.\n5. Finally, the script includes the footer file (optional).\n\n**Note**: This is a simple example to get you started. In a real-world application, you would likely want to add more features, such as:\n\n* Validating user input\n* Querying a database using PDO or MySQLi\n* Displaying search results in a list or table\n* Handling pagination and filtering\n\nAlso, this example uses `$_POST` to get the search query. If you're using a different method (e.g., GET), you'll need to modify the code accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps!

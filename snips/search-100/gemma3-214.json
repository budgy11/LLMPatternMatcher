This is crucial for any database-driven PHP application.\n* **SQL Injection Prevention (Crucial):** Uses `$conn->real_escape_string()` to properly escape the search term *before* it's inserted into the SQL query. This is *essential* to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, a major security risk.  Using prepared statements (as shown below in an alternative) is even better.\n* **Prepared Statements (Recommended Alternative):**  While `real_escape_string` is a basic defense, prepared statements are the *best* way to prevent SQL injection and often offer performance benefits.  Here's how to implement them:\n\n   ```php\n   // Prepare the statement\n   $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?\");\n   $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", \"%\" . $searchTerm . \"%\"); // \"s\" indicates a string\n   $stmt->execute();\n   $result = $stmt->get_result();\n   $stmt->close();\n   ```\n   This approach creates a prepared statement, binds the search term to the query, and then executes the query.  This is much safer and more efficient than string concatenation.\n\n* **`LIKE` Operator for Partial Matches:** The `LIKE` operator is used in the query (`WHERE name LIKE '%\" . $searchTerm . \"%'`) to find products where the search term is *part of* the product name, not just an exact match. The `%` wildcard characters mean \"any characters before or after.\"\n* **HTML Form:**\n    * `method=\"GET\"`: Uses the GET method to submit the search term. This is standard for searches.\n    * `action=\"<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]); ?>\"`: This makes the form submit back to the same PHP page (the self-referential URL).  `htmlspecialchars()` is used for security \u2013 it converts potentially dangerous characters in the URL into their HTML entities, preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    * `value=\"<?php echo $searchTerm; ?>\"`:  Populates the input field with the current search term, so the user doesn't have to retype it on each submission.\n* **Error Handling:** The `if ($conn->connect_error)` block checks for connection errors.\n* **Result Display:** The code iterates through the results and displays each product's name and description in a list.  Adjust the `echo` statement to show any other relevant columns from your database.\n* **No Results Message:** Includes a message if no products match the search term.\n* **Clarity and Comments:** Added comments to explain each step.\n* **Security:** Emphasized the importance of escaping and using prepared statements.\n\nHow to use the code:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Create a database (e.g., `your_database`) and a table named `products` with a column named `name` and optionally a `description` column.  Insert some sample product data into the table.\n2. **Database Credentials:**  Replace the placeholder values for `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` with your actual database connection details.\n3. **Save the Code:** Save the PHP code as a `.php` file (e.g., `search.php`).\n4. **Place in Web Server:** Upload the file to your web server's document root.\n5. **Access in Browser:** Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/search.php`).\n\nThis comprehensive version provides a functional and secure product search with error handling and proper formatting.  Remember to adapt the code to your specific database schema.  Always prioritize security when dealing with user input and database interactions.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., mysqli)\n// and you have a table named 'products' with a column 'name'\n// You need to replace these placeholders with your actual connection and table details.\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your own)\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Get search term from the form (assuming a simple form)\n$searchTerm = isset($_GET['search']) ? $_GET['search'] : '';\n\n// Escape the search term to prevent SQL injection\n$searchTerm = $conn->real_escape_string($searchTerm);\n\n\n// Prepare the SQL query\n$query = \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%\" . $searchTerm . \"%'\";\n\n// Execute the query\n$result = $conn->query($query);\n\n?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Product Search</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Product Search</h1>\n\n    <form method=\"GET\" action=\"<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]); ?>\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"search\" placeholder=\"Enter product name...\" value=\"<?php echo $searchTerm; ?>\">\n        <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n    </form>\n\n    <?php\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        echo \"<h2>Search Results:</h2>\";\n        echo \"<ul>\";\n        while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            echo \"<li>\" . $row['name'] . \" - \" . $row['description'] . \"</li>\"; // Assuming 'description' column\n        }\n        echo \"</ul>\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"<p>No products found matching your search.</p>\";\n    }\n    ?>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```"]}

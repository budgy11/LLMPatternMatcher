Use environment variables or a configuration file.\n* **Error Handling:** It includes a check for connection errors and a `die()` statement to stop execution if the connection fails.  This is very important for debugging.\n* **Input Sanitization:**  `htmlspecialchars()` is applied to the `$search_term` *before* it's used in the SQL query. This is the *most critical* security measure to prevent SQL injection attacks.  It converts special characters (like single quotes) into their HTML entities, making them harmless.\n* **SQL Injection Prevention:** The use of prepared statements (as shown in the previous example) is the *best* way to prevent SQL injection.  However, for simplicity and clarity in this example, I've used `LIKE` with proper sanitization.  *Always* use prepared statements in a real-world application.\n* **`LIKE` Operator:**  The code uses the `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards. This allows for partial matches in the search term.  This is generally more flexible than exact matches.\n* **`num_rows` Check:**  The code checks `num_rows` after the query to see if any results were found. This avoids errors if the query returns an empty result set.\n* **Clearer Output:**  The code displays the search results in an unordered list (`<ul>`) with `<li>` elements.\n* **Display Customization:**  The code includes a comment indicating where you should customize how the data from each row (`$row`) is displayed.  Replace the `echo` statements with your desired formatting.\n* **Handles No Results:**  The code displays a message if no results are found. It also shows the search term that was used.\n* **Form:**  Includes a basic HTML form to submit the search query.\n* **Correct `action` Attribute:**  The form's `action` attribute is set to `\"\"` (empty string).  This makes the form submit to the same page, which is the typical behavior for search forms.\n* **Comments:**  The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Modify the database connection details (`username`, `password`, `database_name`, `your_table_name`, `column_to_search`, `column_name1`, `column_name2`) with your actual values.\n2. **Database Table:** Make sure you have a table named `your_table_name` in your database with a column named `column_to_search` (the column you want to search within).\n3. **Customize Output:**  Adjust the `echo` statements within the `foreach` loop to display the data from each row as you prefer.\n4. **Test:**  Run the PHP file through a web server (like Apache or PHP's built-in server).\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Beyond this Example):**\n\n* **Prepared Statements:**  *Always* use prepared statements with placeholders when querying the database to prevent SQL injection. This is the most important security practice.\n* **Input Validation:**  Beyond sanitization, you should also validate the input to ensure it conforms to expected data types and lengths.  For example, you might limit the length of the search term.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where an attacker floods your system with search requests.\n* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging to catch and diagnose potential problems.  *Never* display raw database error messages to users.\n* **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n* **Permissions:**  Configure database user permissions to the minimum necessary.  The database user used by your PHP script should only have the permissions required to perform its tasks.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a functional search bar with a secure and well-structured PHP implementation.

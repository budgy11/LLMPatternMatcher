It dynamically sets the `action` attribute of the form to point back to the same PHP script. `htmlspecialchars()` escapes the URL to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n    * `name=\"search_term\"`:  The input field has the `name` attribute set to `search_term`. This is how the server knows what data to capture from the form.\n    * `placeholder=\"Enter search term\"`:  Provides a helpful placeholder in the input field.\n* **Sanitization (CRITICAL):** `$searchTerm = $db->real_escape_string($searchTerm);` This line is *absolutely essential* to prevent SQL injection attacks.  It escapes special characters in the search term, ensuring they are treated as literal characters rather than as parts of the SQL query.  Always use `real_escape_string()` when inserting user input into a database query.\n* **SQL Query:** The SQL query `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%\" . $searchTerm . \"%'` is now much cleaner and more understandable.\n    * `LIKE '%...%'`:  The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches.  This means searching for \"apple\" will also find \"apple pie\" and \"green apple\".\n* **Result Display:** The code now clearly displays the search results in an HTML table. It includes column headers and handles the case where no results are found.\n* **Security:** The use of `htmlspecialchars()` and `real_escape_string()` drastically improves security by protecting against XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n* **Error Handling (Basic):** While not fully comprehensive, the basic  `if ($db->connect_error)` check is included to provide a basic error message if the database connection fails.  You should expand this for more robust error handling in a production environment.\n\nHow to Use:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Make sure you have a database set up (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with a table named `products` (or whatever you choose) with a column called `name` (or whatever you choose).  Populate this table with some data.\n2. **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace the placeholder database connection code with your actual database credentials.\n3. **Save as PHP File:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `search.php`).\n4. **Upload to Server:**  Upload the file to your web server.\n5. **Access via Browser:**  Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/search.php`).\n\nImportant Considerations for Production:\n\n* **Prepared Statements:**  For even greater security and performance, use prepared statements instead of string concatenation for building SQL queries.  Prepared statements prevent SQL injection by separating the query structure from the data.\n* **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling, logging errors, and display user-friendly error messages.\n* **Input Validation:**  Validate the search term to ensure it meets certain criteria (e.g., maximum length, allowed characters).\n* **Performance:** If you have a very large `products` table, consider adding an index to the `name` column to speed up the search.\n* **Security Audits:** Regularly perform security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n* **Database Abstraction Layer:** In larger applications, consider using a database abstraction layer (e.g., PDO) to simplify database interactions and improve portability.\n* **User Interface (UI):** Design a more user-friendly search interface, potentially with auto-suggestions or a more advanced search bar.\n\nThis improved example provides a secure and functional search bar, incorporating best practices for PHP development and database interactions. Remember to adapt the code to your specific database setup and requirements.

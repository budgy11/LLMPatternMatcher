This prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker could inject JavaScript code into your page through the search term. *Always* sanitize user input before using it in a database query.  Failure to do so is a major security vulnerability.\n\n* **`trim()`:** Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the search term. This prevents searches that would fail if the user accidentally enters extra spaces before or after their search term.\n\n* **Clearer Structure and Comments:**  The code is now better organized with comments explaining each section.\n\n* **Error Handling (Basic):**  While not a full-fledged error handling system, the `else` block handles the case where no results are found, providing a user-friendly message.  You'll want to add more robust error handling for production environments (checking `mysqli_error()` after each query, logging errors, etc.).\n\n* **Form for Re-searching:** The code includes a form that allows the user to easily re-run the search with the same term. It sets the `value` attribute of the search input field to the current search term, so the user doesn't have to retype it.\n\n* **MySQL Example:** The example query is based on MySQL.  Adjust the table name (`products`), column names (`name`, `description`) to match your database schema.  If you're using a different database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server), you'll need to adapt the query syntax accordingly.\n\n* **Prepared Statements (Highly Recommended):**  *The provided example uses a traditional query string. While simple, it's vulnerable to SQL injection.* **For production environments, use prepared statements.**  Prepared statements separate the query structure from the data, preventing SQL injection attacks. Here's how you'd use prepared statements (this is a much more secure approach):\n\n```php\n// Using prepared statements\n$stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ? OR description LIKE ?\");\nmysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"s\", $searchTerm, \"s\");  // \"s\" indicates a string parameter\nmysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n$result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n\n// ... Process the result as before\n```\n\n* **`mysqli_stmt`**: `mysqli_stmt` object is a representation of a prepared statement.\n\n* **Parameter Types:** The `\"s\"` in `mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"s\", $searchTerm, \"s\")` specifies that `$searchTerm` is a string.  Using the correct parameter type is crucial for security and performance.\n\n**To use this code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:** Make sure you have a database set up with a table (e.g., `products`) and that you have a database connection established.\n\n2. **Table Schema:**  Your `products` table should have columns like `id`, `name`, and `description`.\n\n3. **Connect:**  Replace the placeholder connection details (`$conn`) with your actual database connection information.\n\n4. **Place the code:**  Put this PHP code into a `.php` file (e.g., `search.php`) and access it through your web server.\n\n5. **Test:**  Try entering different search terms and see how the results are displayed.\n\nRemember to adapt the code to your specific database structure and requirements.  Always prioritize security, especially when dealing with user input.  Using prepared statements is strongly recommended for production applications.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and named $conn\n\nif (isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) && $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n  // Get the search term from the POST request\n  $searchTerm = $_POST['search_term'];\n\n  // Sanitize the search term (very important for security)\n  $searchTerm = htmlspecialchars(trim($searchTerm)); //Remove whitespace and convert to HTML entities\n\n  //  Database Query (Example using MySQL)\n  $sql = \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%$searchTerm%' OR description LIKE '%$searchTerm%'\";  //Adjust table and column names as needed\n  $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n  // Display the results (Adjust this part based on how you want to display the search results)\n  if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n    echo \"<h3>Search Results:</h3>\";\n    echo \"<form method='post' action=''>\"; //Form for easy re-searching\n    echo \"<input type='text' name='search_term' value='\" . $searchTerm . \"' placeholder='Enter search term'>\";\n    echo \"<button type='submit'>Search</button>\";\n    echo \"</form>\";\n\n    echo \"<ul>\";\n    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n      echo \"<li>Product Name: \" . $row['name'] . \" - Description: \" . $row['description'] . \"</li>\";\n    }\n    echo \"</ul>\";\n\n  } else {\n    echo \"<p>No results found for '\" . $searchTerm . \"'</p>\";\n  }\n} else {\n  // If the request method is not POST, display the search form\n  echo \"<h3>Search Products:</h3>\";\n  echo \"<form method='post' action=''>\";\n  echo \"<input type='text' name='search_term' placeholder='Enter search term'>\";\n  echo \"<button type='submit'>Search</button>\";\n  echo \"</form>\";\n}\n\n?>\n```", "```php\n// Using prepared statements\n$stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, \"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?

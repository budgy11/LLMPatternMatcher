In the `index.php` file, we first initialize two variables: `$searchTerm` to store the search term entered by the user, and `$results` to store any matching results from the database.\n2. We use PHP's built-in `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']` variable to check if the form has been submitted (i.e., when the user clicks the \"Search\" button). If it has, we proceed to get the search term from the form data using `$_POST['search_term']`.\n3. Next, we query the database for matching results using a SQL query that uses the `LIKE` operator with wildcard characters (`%`) to match any text in the specified column.\n4. We use a `while` loop to fetch each result from the database and add it to the `$results` array.\n5. Finally, if the form has been submitted, we display the search results using PHP's `print_r()` function (in a real-world application, you'd want to display the results in a more user-friendly format).\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This example uses MySQL as the database engine, but you can modify it to work with other databases like PostgreSQL or SQLite.\n* The SQL query uses the `LIKE` operator with wildcard characters (`%`) to match any text in the specified column. Be aware that this may lead to performance issues if the search term is very long or contains many special characters.\n* This example assumes you have a basic understanding of PHP and MySQL.\n\n**Security Note:**\n\n* When working with user input (in this case, the search term), always use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n* Use `htmlspecialchars()` to escape any HTML-special characters in the search term before using it in your SQL query.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to add any additional features or security measures!", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Initialize variables\n$searchTerm = '';\n$results = array();\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    // Get the search term from the form data\n    $searchTerm = $_POST['search_term'];\n\n    // Query the database for matching results\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM your_table_name WHERE column_name LIKE '%$searchTerm%'\";\n    $result = mysql_query($query);\n    while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        $results[] = $row;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", null]}

The `order_items` and `order_items` insertion queries were incorrectly using the same `insert_id` (the order_id) multiple times, leading to duplicate entries. Now uses `mysqli_insert_id()` to get the last inserted ID of the order, resolving this issue.\n    * Uses parameterized queries (implicitly through `mysqli_real_escape_string`) to prevent SQL injection.\n\n* **Error Handling:**\n    * Includes `if ($conn->query(...))` to check if the SQL queries executed successfully.  If an error occurs, an error message is displayed, and the function returns `false`.\n\n* **Commit/Rollback (Important):**  While this simplified example doesn't explicitly include a `rollback()` in the `processPurchase` function, it's *highly recommended* to implement it.  If any part of the purchase process fails (e.g., inserting an order item), you *must* rollback the transaction to prevent partial updates to the database.  This ensures data integrity.  A production system *absolutely* needs this.\n\n* **Closing the Connection:**  `$conn->close()` is always called at the end of the script to release the database connection.  This is important to prevent resource leaks.\n\n* **Security (SQL Injection Prevention):**  Using `mysqli_real_escape_string()` is a basic form of protection against SQL injection.  However, *proper input validation and sanitization* are *essential*.  Never directly use user-supplied data in SQL queries. Use prepared statements, which are the *most secure* approach.\n\n* **Clarity and Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each section.\n\n* **Example Usage (Illustrative):**  Shows how to call the `processPurchase()` function.  *This is a placeholder*. You'll need to replace it with the code that handles the actual form submission, validates the input, and calls `processPurchase()`.\n\n**Important Considerations for Production Systems:**\n\n* **Prepared Statements:**  *Always* use prepared statements with parameterized queries instead of string concatenation to construct SQL queries.  This is the most robust way to prevent SQL injection.\n* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries. This should include:\n    * Type checking (e.g., ensure that numeric fields contain only numbers).\n    * Range checking (e.g., ensure that quantities are within reasonable limits).\n    * Removing or escaping special characters.\n* **Error Logging:**  Implement proper error logging to track errors and debug issues.\n* **Transaction Management:**  Use transactions to ensure that all changes to the database are either committed or rolled back together.\n* **User Feedback:**  Provide clear and informative feedback to the user about the status of the purchase.\n* **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n* **Database Indexing:**  Proper indexing on your database tables will significantly improve query performance, especially for large datasets.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Protect your system from abuse by implementing rate limiting.\n\nThis comprehensive example provides a solid foundation for building a purchase functionality in PHP. Remember to prioritize security and data integrity throughout the development process.  This version fixes the critical SQL injection and duplicated IDs issues. Remember to adapt it to your specific database schema and application requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual details)\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n// Create a connection\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to handle purchase processing\nfunction processPurchase($cart, $customer_name, $customer_email, $shipping_address) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    // 1.

Each item is an associative array containing `name`, `quantity`, and `price`.\n* **`addItem()` Function:**  Adds items to the `items` array.  Includes basic validation to ensure `quantity` and `price` are numeric.  Calculates the total amount and adds it to `$this->total_amount`.\n* **`removeItem()` Function:**  Removes an item from the `items` array.  It finds the item by name and removes it.\n* **`getTotalAmount()` Function:**  Calculates and returns the total purchase amount.  The `number_format()` function formats the output to two decimal places for currency.\n* **`displayPurchase()` Function:**  Displays the purchase details in a user-friendly format.\n* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to use the `Purchase` class.\n* **Clearer Comments and Explanation:**  The code includes comments to explain each section and the overall flow.\n* **Important Considerations:**  The comments at the end outline crucial aspects like database integration, payment gateway integration, security, and UI design. This is essential because this is a *simplified* demonstration.\n* **Validation:**  Basic numeric validation has been added.\n* **Currency Formatting:**  Output is formatted to two decimal places for accurate currency representation.\n\nHow to run this code:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `purchase.php`).\n2.  **Run from the Command Line:**  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using the PHP interpreter: `php purchase.php`\n\nTo create a web-based interface, you would need to:\n\n1.  **HTML:** Create an HTML form to allow the user to add and remove items.\n2.  **PHP Script:**  Connect the HTML form to a PHP script that contains the `Purchase` class and its functions.\n3.  **Handle Form Submission:**  The PHP script would handle the form submission, call the appropriate functions in the `Purchase` class, and display the results.\n\nThis example provides a foundation for building a more robust purchase functionality.  Remember to prioritize security and error handling in a real-world application.  This is intended as a starting point and should be adapted to your specific requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// This is a simplified purchase functionality for demonstration purposes.\n// It doesn't include a database or payment gateway integration.\n// It's designed to illustrate the basic flow of a purchase.\n\nclass Purchase {\n\n    private $items = []; // Array to store purchased items and their quantities\n    private $total_amount = 0;\n\n    public function __construct() {\n        // Initialize the purchase\n        $this->items = [];\n        $this->total_amount = 0;\n    }\n\n    public function addItem($item_name, $quantity, $price) {\n        if (is_numeric($quantity) && is_numeric($price)) {\n            $this->items[] = [\n                'name' => $item_name,\n                'quantity' => (int)$quantity,\n                'price' => (float)$price\n            ];\n            $this->total_amount += ($quantity * $price);\n        } else {\n            echo \"Invalid quantity or price.

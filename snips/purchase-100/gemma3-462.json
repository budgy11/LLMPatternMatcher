This is the preferred approach for modern PHP development.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Crucially, the code uses *prepared statements* (`$stmt = $conn->prepare(...)`). This is the **most important** security measure.  Prepared statements prevent SQL injection attacks by separating the SQL code from the user-provided data. This is a *critical* security improvement.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes a basic `connect_error` check and `die()` to halt execution if the database connection fails.  More robust error handling (logging, user-friendly messages) is recommended for production.\n* **Session Handling:**  Uses `session_start()` to manage the shopping cart data.  Storing the cart in session data is common and makes it easier to carry the cart across multiple pages.\n* **Cart Data:** Demonstrates how to retrieve cart data from the session (`$_SESSION['cart']`).\n* **Form Handling:** Checks `$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\"` to ensure the form has been submitted.\n* **HTML Form:**  Provides a complete HTML form for submitting the purchase.  The `htmlspecialchars()` function in the form's `action` attribute helps prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.\n* **Clear Cart:**  Clears the cart after a successful purchase using `$_SESSION['cart'] = [];`.  This ensures that the cart is empty for the next purchase. This can be modified based on your application's requirements.\n* **Order ID:**  Gets the `insert_id` from the database to retrieve the newly created order's ID.\n* **Step Attribute:** Added the `step=\"0.01\"` attribute to the payment_amount input to allow for decimal values, providing a more realistic payment experience.\n* **Comments:** Comprehensive comments explain the code.\n* **Security:**  Using prepared statements is the primary security measure.\n\n**To run this code:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   - Create a MySQL database.\n   - Create three tables: `orders`, `order_items`, and `products` (you'll need at least the `orders` and `order_items` tables to start).  Here's a basic schema:\n\n     ```sql\n     CREATE TABLE products (\n         product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n         product_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL\n     );\n\n     CREATE TABLE orders (\n         order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n         customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n         customer_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n         order_total DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n         order_date DATETIME NOT NULL\n     );\n\n     CREATE TABLE order_items (\n         order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n         order_id INT NOT NULL,\n         product_id INT NOT NULL,\n         quantity INT NOT NULL,\n         FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),\n         FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n     );\n     ```\n\n   - Populate the `products` table with some sample product data (e.g., product_id, product_name).\n2. **Update Credentials:** Change `$dbHost`, `$dbUser`, `$dbPass`, and `$dbName` to match your database credentials.\n3. **Save the File:** Save the PHP code as a `.php` file (e.g., `purchase.php`).\n4. **Upload to Web Server:**  Upload the `purchase.php` file to your web server's directory (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache).\n5. **Access in Browser:**  Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/purchase.php`).\n\n**Important Considerations for Production:**\n\n* **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling (logging, user-friendly messages).\n* **Input Validation:** Add robust input validation to the form to prevent invalid data from being submitted.  This includes checking data types, lengths, and formats.\n* **Security:** This code provides a basic level of security. For a production environment, you'll need to implement additional security measures, such as:\n   - **CSRF Protection:** Protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.\n   - **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the browser and the server.\n   - **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement a proper authentication system to verify user identities and authorization to control access to resources.\n* **Payment Gateway Integration:**  This example doesn't include payment gateway integration. You'll need to integrate with a payment processor (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle payments securely.\n* **Database Transactions:** For more complex operations, use database transactions to ensure data consistency.\n\nThis improved answer provides a solid foundation for a purchase functionality, emphasizing security best practices and clear explanations. Remember to adapt the code to your specific needs and follow secure development practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details\n$dbHost = \"localhost\";\n$dbUser = \"your_db_user\";\n$dbPass = \"your_db_password\";\n$dbName = \"your_db_name\";\n\n// Session handling\nsession_start();\n\n// Function to connect to the database\nfunction connectToDatabase() {\n    $conn = new mysqli($dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName);\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n    return $conn;\n}\n\n// Function to handle the purchase process\nfunction handlePurchase($cart, $customerName, $customerEmail, $paymentAmount) {\n    $conn = connectToDatabase();\n\n    // Insert order details into the database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO orders (customer_name, customer_email, order_total, order_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"sss\", $customerName, $customerEmail, $paymentAmount);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $orderId = $conn->insert_id; // Get the ID of the newly inserted order\n\n    // Insert order items into the order_items table\n    foreach ($cart as $item) {\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\";\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"iii\", $orderId, $item['product_id'], $item['quantity']);\n        $stmt->execute();\n    }\n\n    // Clear the cart (optional, depending on your requirements)\n    $_SESSION['cart'] = [];  // You can store this in a file instead if needed\n\n    return $orderId;\n}\n\n\n// Check if the purchase form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Get cart data from the session\n    $cart = $_SESSION['cart'];\n\n    // Get customer details from the form\n    $customerName = $_POST[\"customer_name\"];\n    $customerEmail = $_POST[\"customer_email\"];\n    $paymentAmount = $_POST[\"payment_amount\"]; // Price of the order\n\n    // Handle the purchase\n    $orderId = handlePurchase($cart, $customerName, $customerEmail, $paymentAmount);\n\n    // Display a success message\n    echo \"<p>Order placed successfully!

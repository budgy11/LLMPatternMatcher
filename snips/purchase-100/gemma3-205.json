This enhances readability and maintainability.\n* **Database Interaction (Simulation):**  The code simulates a database interaction.  The `handlePurchase` function now includes database insertion logic.  It uses `mysqli` (you'll need to adjust based on your database library).\n* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included.  The code checks if the database connection is successful and gracefully handles the case where a product ID is not found.  More robust error handling (e.g., try/catch blocks) should be added for a production environment.\n* **Data Validation (Important Omission - needs to be added):**  This example doesn't include data validation (e.g., checking that quantities are positive integers).  *This is crucial* in a real-world application to prevent invalid data from being inserted into the database.\n* **JSON Encoding:** The `order_details` are now properly encoded as a JSON string before being stored in the database. This is the recommended way to handle complex, potentially changing data structures in a database.  `json_encode()` is the function to use for this.\n* **Database Table Definition (Commented Out):**  I've included a commented-out SQL statement to create the `orders` table. You'll need to create this table in your database.  Adjust data types as needed (e.g., `DECIMAL(10,2)` for currency).\n* **`insert_id`:** The example uses `$conn->insert_id` to retrieve the automatically generated primary key of the newly created order.  This is useful if you want to refer to the order later.\n* **Comments and Explanation:**  The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step.\n* **Security Considerations (Important):**  *This code is a simplified example and does not include all necessary security measures.*  In a real application, you *must* implement security best practices, including:\n    * **Input Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.  Use prepared statements with bound parameters (as shown in the code) to mitigate SQL injection.\n    * **Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to the purchase functionality.\n    * **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.\n\nHow to Use:\n\n1. **Database Setup:** Create the `orders` table as defined in the comments (or adjust the SQL to your specific needs).\n2. **Database Connection:** Replace the placeholder `mysqli` connection details with your actual database credentials.\n3. **Product Data:** Modify the `$products` array with your actual product data.  This data should come from your database.\n4. **User Input:** Add HTML forms to allow users to select products and specify quantities.  The values from these forms will be passed to your PHP script.\n5. **Implement Forms:** Create HTML forms to allow the user to select products and enter the quantity.  Process these form submissions in the PHP script.\n6. **Update `$cart`:** Update the `$cart` array with the selected products and quantities.\n7. **Call `handlePurchase()`:**  Call the `handlePurchase()` function with the `$cart` and the database connection.\n8. **Display Results:**  Display a confirmation message (or an error message) to the user.\n\nRemember to replace the example `cart` with data from the user's selections.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more complete and functional foundation for your purchase functionality, along with important security considerations and clear instructions on how to use the code.  It also emphasizes the crucial aspect of database integration.  Always prioritize security in your development process.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., mysqli)\n// $conn = new mysqli(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\n\n// Check connection\n// if ($conn->connect_error) {\n//   die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n// }\n\n//  Example using a dummy product array for simplicity (replace with database query)\n$products = [\n    ['id' => 1, 'name' => 'T-Shirt', 'price' => 20],\n    ['id' => 2, 'name' => 'Jeans', 'price' => 50],\n    ['id' => 3, 'name' => 'Hat', 'price' => 15]\n];\n\n\n// Function to handle the purchase process\nfunction handlePurchase($cart, $conn) {\n  $total = 0;\n  $order_details = [];\n\n  foreach ($cart as $item_id => $quantity) {\n    // Find the product details based on the item_id\n    $product = null;\n    foreach ($products as $p) {\n      if ($p['id'] == $item_id) {\n        $product = $p;\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n\n    if ($product) {\n      $price = $product['price'] * $quantity;\n      $total += $price;\n      $order_details[] = [\n        'product_id' => $item_id,\n        'product_name' => $product['name'],\n        'quantity' => $quantity,\n        'price' => $price\n      ];\n    } else {\n      // Handle the case where the product ID is not found (e.g., display an error)\n      echo \"Product with ID \" . $item_id . \" not found.\";\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Insert order details into a database table (replace with your database insertion)\n  if ($conn) {\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO orders (total_amount, order_details) VALUES (?, ?)\";\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"sd\", $total, json_encode($order_details));  // json_encode for compatibility\n    $stmt->execute();\n    echo \"Order placed successfully!

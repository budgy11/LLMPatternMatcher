Replace the placeholder connection details (`$db_host`, `$db_name`, etc.) with your actual database credentials.  Importantly, it includes error handling to catch connection issues.\n* **`connectToDatabase()` function:** Encapsulates the database connection logic, making the code more organized and reusable.\n* **`handlePurchase()` function:**  This is the core function that performs the purchase process. It takes the shopping cart data and customer information as input.\n* **SQL Prepared Statements:**  This is *crucial* for security.  Using prepared statements prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.  The `prepare()` method creates a prepared statement, and the `bind_param()` method binds the variables to the statement.  This separates data from SQL code, preventing malicious code from being executed.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes `if (!$stmt->execute())` checks after each `execute()` call to catch any errors and display them.  Robust error handling is essential for production systems.\n* **Order Item Insertion:** Iterates through the `$cart` array and inserts each item into the `order_items` table.\n* **Product Stock Update (Optional):** Includes a basic example of updating product stock. *Important:*  This is a simplified example and may not be suitable for high-volume sales. You'll need to implement concurrency control and more sophisticated stock management in a real application (e.g., using transactions and locking mechanisms).\n* **Confirmation Message:** Displays a confirmation message after a successful purchase.\n* **Simulated Form Submission:**  The code includes a simulated form submission section that demonstrates how to handle a form submission and call the `handlePurchase()` function.\n* **Security:** Uses `htmlspecialchars()` to escape output when displaying the form URL, preventing potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n* **Clearer Comments & Structure:**  The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step. The structure is improved for better readability.\n* **Database Table Structure (Assumed):**\n    * **orders:**\n        * `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        * `customer_name` (VARCHAR)\n        * `customer_email` (VARCHAR)\n        * `address` (TEXT)\n        * `order_date` (DATETIME)\n        * `payment_method` (VARCHAR)\n    * **order_items:**\n        * `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        * `order_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing `orders.id`)\n        * `product_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing `products.id`)\n        * `quantity` (INT)\n    * **products:**\n        * `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n        * `name` (VARCHAR)\n        * `price` (DECIMAL)\n        * `stock` (INT)\n* **Clearer Placeholders:** Uses placeholders like `your_username` and `your_password` to emphasize that you must replace them with your actual credentials.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1. **Set up your database:** Create the `orders`, `order_items`, and `products` tables in your MySQL database. Make sure the table structures match the assumptions in the code.\n2. **Replace placeholders:** Update the database connection details (`$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, `$db_password`) with your actual credentials.\n3. **Run the code:**  Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `purchase.php`) and upload it to your web server.\n4. **Access the form:** Open the form in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/purchase.php`).\n5. **Submit the form:**  Fill out the form with the customer information and product details.  The `cart` array represents the items being purchased.\n6. **Verify the database:** After submitting the form, check your database to ensure that the order and order items have been created correctly.\n\nImportant considerations for a production system:\n\n* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  *Always* validate and sanitize all user input to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities.  This includes checking data types, lengths, formats, and removing potentially malicious characters.  Use appropriate functions like `filter_var()` for sanitization.\n* **Error Logging:** Implement robust error logging to track errors and debug issues.\n* **Transaction Management:**  Use database transactions to ensure that all operations related to a purchase are completed successfully or rolled back in case of an error.\n* **Concurrency Control:**  Implement concurrency control mechanisms to handle multiple concurrent users and prevent data inconsistencies.  This is especially important when updating product stock.\n* **Session Management:**  Use sessions to track user activity and maintain state.\n* **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n* **Payment Gateway Integration:** For a real e-commerce system, you'll need to integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) to securely process payments.\n* **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the code to ensure that it works correctly and is secure.\n\nThis revised answer provides a complete and secure foundation for building a purchase functionality.  Remember to adapt it to your specific requirements and thoroughly test it before deploying it to a production environment. Remember that creating a full-fledged e-commerce system is a complex undertaking.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection details (replace with your actual details)\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'e_commerce_db';\n$db_user = 'your_username';\n$db_password = 'your_password';\n\n// Function to connect to the database\nfunction connectToDatabase() {\n    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name);\n\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    return $conn;\n}\n\n// Function to handle purchase process\nfunction handlePurchase($cart, $customer_name, $customer_email, $address, $payment_method) {\n    $conn = connectToDatabase();\n\n    // 1.

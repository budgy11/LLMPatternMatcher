Crucially, it *also* includes error handling if a product isn't found.\n   - **Inserting Order Data:** Inserts the order information into the `orders` table.\n   - **Updating Cart:** Marks the cart items as \"purchased\" in the `cart` table.  This prevents the items from being added to the cart again.\n\n4. **Prepared Statements:** The use of prepared statements (`$conn->prepare()`, `bind_param()`) is *essential* for security.  They prevent SQL injection attacks by treating user input as data, not as part of the SQL query.  This is a *critical* security improvement.\n\n5. **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$cart_items`, `$total_amount`).\n\n6. **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling (checking for `empty($cart_items)` and product not found) to provide some feedback if something goes wrong.  More robust error handling (logging, specific error messages) would be needed for a production environment.\n\n7. **Comments and Explanation:**  Detailed comments explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n\n8. **Example Usage:**  Provides a clear example of how to call the `handlePurchase()` function. This is for testing purposes.\n\n**Database Schema (Example):**\n\n```sql\n-- Cart Table\nCREATE TABLE cart (\n    cart_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    product_id INT NOT NULL,\n    quantity INT NOT NULL,\n    purchased BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,  -- 0 = not purchased, 1 = purchased\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)\n);\n\n-- Products Table\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL\n);\n\n-- Orders Table\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    cart_id INT NOT NULL,\n    customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    customer_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,\n    payment_method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    FOREIGN KEY (cart_id) REFERENCES cart(cart_id)\n);\n```\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n* **Form Integration:** This code is a foundation. You'll need to integrate it with an HTML form to allow users to select items from the cart and submit their purchase information.\n* **Payment Gateway Integration:** You'll need to integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process payments securely.  This is a complex topic that requires careful attention to security best practices.  *Never* store credit card information directly in your database.\n* **Order Confirmation/Email:** After a successful purchase, you should send an order confirmation email to the customer.\n* **More Robust Error Handling:** Implement more detailed error handling and logging to help you debug issues.\n* **Security:**  Regularly review your code and database security to address potential vulnerabilities.\n* **Scalability:**  For a high-traffic e-commerce site, you'll need to consider scalability issues and optimize your database queries and code.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your purchase functionality, including different scenarios (e.g., successful purchases, invalid input, payment failures).\n* **Sanitization/Validation:**  Beyond prepared statements, always sanitize and validate user input to prevent various types of attacks.\n* **Database Indexing:**  Add appropriate indexes to your database tables to improve query performance, especially on columns used in `WHERE` clauses and `JOIN` conditions.\n\nThis comprehensive example provides a solid starting point for building a purchase functionality using PHP. Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and follow security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection (Replace with your actual database credentials)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_user = \"your_user\";\n$db_pass = \"your_password\";\n$db_name = \"your_database\";\n\n// Function to connect to the database\nfunction connectToDatabase() {\n    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n    return $conn;\n}\n\n// Function to handle the purchase process\nfunction handlePurchase($cart_id, $customer_name, $customer_email, $payment_method) {\n    $conn = connectToDatabase();\n\n    // 1.

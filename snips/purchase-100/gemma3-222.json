This is a more modern and common approach than older methods.  **Important:** Replace the placeholder database details (`$host`, `$username`, `$password`, `$dbname`) with your actual database credentials.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling:\n    * `mysqli` connection errors are checked and handled with `die()`.\n    * Product ID validation (crucially, checks if the product exists in the `products` table).  This prevents attempting to add a purchase for a non-existent product.  Logs the error using `error_log()` for debugging.\n    * SQL error handling (the `if ($stmt->execute())` block checks for errors during query execution).\n* **`mysqli` Prepared Statements:**  This is *essential* for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code uses prepared statements (`$conn->prepare()`, `$stmt->bind_param()`, `$stmt->execute()`) to properly handle user input and escape data. This is critical for security.\n* **`mysqli`  `insert_id`:**  The code now correctly gets the newly created purchase ID using `$conn->insert_id`. This is the standard way to retrieve the ID of the last inserted row in a `mysqli` database.\n* **Date/Time:**  `NOW()` is used in the SQL query to automatically record the date and time of the purchase.\n* **Form Handling:**  The example usage is now within an HTML form.  The `$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\"` check ensures that the purchase is only processed when the form is submitted.\n* **Input Validation (Basic):**  `required` attribute is added to the input fields in the HTML form to make them mandatory.\n* **Security:** The use of prepared statements and the correct handling of data are the most important security aspects of this code.\n* **Clearer Code Structure:** The code is well-commented and structured for readability and maintainability.\n* **Error Logging:**  `error_log()` is used to log errors. This helps you debug the code and understand why a purchase might fail.  Check your server's error logs (e.g., `/var/log/apache2/error.log` on Linux) to see these logs.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1. **Set up your database:** Create a database and a table named `purchases` with the following columns (at minimum):\n   * `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n   * `product_id` (INT)\n   * `quantity` (INT)\n   * `customer_name` (VARCHAR)\n   * `customer_email` (VARCHAR)\n   * `purchase_date` (TIMESTAMP)\n   * You might also want to create a `products` table with `id` and `product_name` columns.\n\n2. **Replace Placeholders:**  Update the database connection details (`$host`, `$username`, `$password`, `$dbname`) with your actual values.\n\n3. **Create the HTML Form:**  Copy the HTML code (the `<!DOCTYPE html>...</html>` part) into an HTML file (e.g., `purchase.html`).\n\n4. **Run the Code:**  Place the HTML file and the PHP code (e.g., `purchase.php`) in the same directory on your web server. Access the `purchase.html` file through your web browser.  This will display the form. When you submit the form, the PHP code will process the purchase and display a success or error message.\n\nImportant Considerations and Next Steps:\n\n* **Product Details:**  This example only checks for the existence of the `product_id`.  In a real application, you'll want to retrieve more details about the product (e.g., name, price) and include them in the purchase record.\n* **Input Validation (Advanced):** Implement more robust input validation on the client-side (using JavaScript) and server-side to prevent invalid data from being entered.  Consider using a library like PHPMailer to send email confirmations.\n* **Error Reporting:**  Configure your PHP error reporting level to display detailed errors during development.  Don't leave it at \"E\" (errors only) in a production environment.\n* **Security:** This is a basic example. For a production application, you'll need to implement more security measures, such as:\n    * **CSRF protection:**  Protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.\n    * **Rate limiting:** Prevent abuse of the purchase functionality.\n    * **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.\n* **Database Transactions:**  For critical operations like purchases, use database transactions to ensure that all operations are either completed successfully or rolled back in case of an error. This prevents data corruption.\n* **User Authentication:**  Add user authentication to restrict access to the purchase functionality.\n* **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the code to ensure that it works correctly under various conditions.\n\nThis improved response provides a much more complete and secure solution, incorporating best practices for PHP development.  Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database connection (Replace with your actual database details)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database\";\n\n// Create a database connection\n$conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// --- Purchase Functionality ---\n\n/**\n * Adds a new purchase to the database.\n *\n * @param int $product_id The ID of the product being purchased.\n * @param int $quantity The quantity of the product being purchased.\n * @param string $customer_name The customer's name.\n * @param string $customer_email The customer's email address.\n *\n * @return int|false The ID of the newly created purchase, or false on failure.\n */\nfunction addPurchase(int $product_id, int $quantity, string $customer_name, string $customer_email) {\n    global $conn; // Access the database connection\n\n    // Check if the product exists (Basic validation - improve with product details)\n    $product_query = \"SELECT id FROM products WHERE id = ?\";\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($product_query);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $product_id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        // Product exists, proceed with adding the purchase\n    } else {\n        // Product does not exist, handle the error appropriately\n        error_log(\"Invalid product ID: \" . $product_id);  // Log the error\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Prepare the SQL query\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO purchases (product_id, quantity, customer_name, customer_email, purchase_date)\n           VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n\n    // Prepare and execute the query\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"isss\", $product_id, $quantity, $customer_name, $customer_email);\n\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        // Get the ID of the newly created purchase\n        $purchase_id = $conn->insert_id;\n        return $purchase_id;\n    } else {\n        // Handle errors\n        error_log(\"Error adding purchase: \" . $stmt->error);\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Close the statement\n    $stmt->close();\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Get product ID and quantity from the form\n    $product_id = $_POST[\"product_id\"];\n    $quantity = $_POST[\"quantity\"];\n    $customer_name = $_POST[\"customer_name\"];\n    $customer_email = $_POST[\"customer_email\"];\n\n    // Add the purchase\n    $purchase_id = addPurchase($product_id, $quantity, $customer_name, $customer_email);\n\n    if ($purchase_id) {\n        echo \"Purchase successful!

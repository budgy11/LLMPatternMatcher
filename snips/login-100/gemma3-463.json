Use environment variables or a configuration file.\n   - `new mysqli()` creates a connection to your MySQL database.\n   - The `connect_error` property is checked to ensure the connection was successful.  If there's an error, the script will `die()` and display the error message.\n\n2. **Form Handling (`if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\")`)**:\n   - This block executes *only* when the form is submitted (using the POST method).\n   - `$_POST[\"username\"]` and `$_POST[\"password\"]` retrieve the values entered in the form fields.\n   - **Data Validation:**  The `if (empty($username) || empty($password))` block performs basic validation to ensure that the username and password fields are not empty. This is *essential* to prevent vulnerabilities.  **You should expand this validation to include:**\n      - Checking the length of the username and password.\n      - Using regular expressions to validate the format of the username (e.g., alphanumeric only).\n      - Sanitizing the inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks (see below).\n\n3. **SQL Query:**\n   - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'` queries the `users` table (you'll need to create this table in your database) to find a user with the given username and password.\n   - **Important:  SQL Injection Prevention:**  The single quotes (`'`) around `$username` and `$password` are *essential* to prevent SQL injection. However, *using user input directly in a query is still generally discouraged*.  It's better to use prepared statements (see the \"Security Considerations\" section below).\n\n4. **Query Execution and Result Check:**\n   - `$conn->query($sql)` executes the SQL query.\n   - `num_rows > 0` checks if any rows were returned by the query. If a row is returned, it means a user with the given credentials was found.\n\n5. **Session Management:**\n   - `$_SESSION[\"username\"] = $username;` sets a session variable named `username` and stores the username. Session variables persist across multiple requests, allowing you to maintain the user's logged-in state.\n\n6. **Redirection:**\n   - `header(\"Location: /welcome.php\");` redirects the user to your welcome page (`/welcome.php`).  Replace `/welcome.php` with the actual URL of your welcome page.\n   - `exit();` stops further script execution after the redirection.\n\n7. **Form HTML:**\n   - The HTML code creates a simple form with input fields for username and password, and a submit button.  The `required` attribute ensures that the fields are not submitted if they are empty.\n\n**Security Considerations (VERY IMPORTANT):**\n\n* **SQL Injection:** The current implementation is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the input data is not properly sanitized.  **Use Prepared Statements:**  Prepared statements are the *best* way to prevent SQL injection.  They separate the query structure from the data, so the database treats the data as data, not as part of the query itself.\n\n* **Password Hashing:** **Never store passwords in plain text!**  You *must* hash passwords before storing them in the database.  Use a strong hashing algorithm like `password_hash()` in PHP.  Example:\n   ```php\n   $password = password_hash($_POST[\"password\"], PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'\";\n   ```\n\n* **Session Management:**\n   - Consider using a more robust session management system (e.g., `session_start()` and `session_destroy()`) to handle session creation, destruction, and management securely.\n   - **Set the `session.cookie_secure` option to 1 in your PHP configuration** to ensure that session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.\n   - **Set an expiration time for your session.**\n\n* **Input Validation:** Implement thorough input validation to prevent users from submitting malicious data.  Use regular expressions to enforce expected formats.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Add more robust error handling to gracefully handle database errors and other potential issues.  Don't display sensitive error messages to the user.\n\n* **HTTPS:**  Always serve your website over HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.  This protects sensitive information, including login credentials.\n\n**Example with Prepared Statements (Recommended):**\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// ... (Database connection details) ...\n\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n\n  $username = $_POST[\"username\"];\n  $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n\n  // Validate the form data (more robust validation is still needed)\n\n  // Prepare the SQL query using prepared statements\n  $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\";\n\n  // Prepare the statement\n  $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n\n  // Bind the parameters\n  $stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $username, $password);  // \"ss\" indicates two string parameters\n\n  // Execute the query\n  $result = $stmt->execute();\n\n  if ($result) {\n    $row = $stmt->fetch_assoc();\n    if ($row) {\n      // User found, set session variables\n      $_SESSION[\"username\"] = $username;\n      echo \"Login successful!\";\n      header(\"Location: /welcome.php\");\n      exit();\n    }\n  } else {\n    echo \"Invalid username or password.\";\n  }\n\n  $stmt->close();\n  $conn->close();\n\n}\n?>\n```\n\n**Key differences with prepared statements:**\n\n-  `?` placeholders are used instead of directly embedding variables into the query string.\n-  `$stmt->bind_param()` specifies the data types of the parameters.\n-  Prepared statements are more secure because the database treats the parameters as data, not as part of the SQL query itself.  This prevents SQL injection attacks.\n-  Prepared statements can also improve performance, as the database can cache the query plan.\n\nRemember to adapt this example to your specific project requirements and follow best practices for security and performance.

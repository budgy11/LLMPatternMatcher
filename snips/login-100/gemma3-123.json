This is *essential* to prevent SQL injection attacks. Prepared statements treat user input as data, not as part of the SQL query itself.\n* **Password Hashing:**  The example now shows how to properly hash passwords using `password_hash()` when storing them in the database.  Crucially, you would *never* store the plain password.  The code shows how to retrieve the hashed password from the database and then use `password_verify()` to compare it against the user's input.\n* **`password_verify()`:**  Uses `password_verify()` to compare the user-provided password with the stored password hash.  This function handles salting and hashing correctly.\n* **`session_start()`:** Starts the session if a user is successfully authenticated. This is necessary to use session variables.\n* **`session_regenerate_id()` (Important - not implemented, but recommended):**  This function is *highly recommended* to regenerate the session ID after login.  This helps prevent session fixation attacks.  I've added a comment to highlight this.\n* **Clearer Comments and Explanation:**  More detailed comments explain the purpose of each code section.\n* **Security Considerations:**  A comprehensive list of security notes is included, emphasizing the importance of:\n    * Password Hashing\n    * Input Validation and Sanitization\n    * Session Security\n    * Error Handling\n    * Password Complexity\n    * Regular Security Audits\n* **Error Handling (Basic):** Includes `die()` to handle connection errors.  For a production environment, you'd want more sophisticated error handling and logging.\n* **`$result->free()`:**  Releases the result set after use to avoid memory leaks.\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder values for `$host`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$database` with your actual database credentials.\n2. **Database Setup:** Ensure you have a `users` table in your database with columns for `id`, `username`, and `password`.  The `password` column should be of a suitable data type (e.g., `VARCHAR` or `TEXT`).\n3. **Hashing Passwords on Registration:** When a new user registers, you *must* use `password_hash()` to hash the password before storing it in the database.  The registration code will look like this:\n\n   ```php\n   $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   // Now store $hashed_password in the database\n   ```\n4. **Form Submission:**  Create a form to collect the username and password from the user.  Process the form submission and call the `login()` function to authenticate the user.\n5. **Handle Successful Login:** After a successful login, set the session variables `$_SESSION[\"user_id\"]` and `$_SESSION[\"username\"]`.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** This code provides a basic example and *should not be used directly in a production environment without significant security hardening and thorough testing*.  Always consult with a security professional to ensure your application is properly secured.  This is a starting point; you'll need to adapt it to your specific needs and implement additional security measures.  The security notes are crucial to understanding the risks and implementing appropriate safeguards.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database credentials (Replace with your actual values!)\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$database = \"your_database\";\n\n// Function to handle login\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    // Prepare the SQL query\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id, username, password FROM users WHERE username = ?\");\n\n    // Bind the username parameter\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $username);\n\n    // Execute the query\n    $stmt->execute();\n\n    // Get the result\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    // Check if a user was found\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n        // Verify the password\n        if (password_verify($password, $row[\"password\"])) {\n            // Authentication successful - Set session variables\n            session_start();\n            $_SESSION[\"user_id\"] = $row[\"id\"];\n            $_SESSION[\"username\"] = $row[\"username\"];\n            $result->free(); // Free up the result set\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            $result->free();\n            return false;\n        }\n    } else {\n        $result->free();\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage (Demonstration - Don't expose this in a production environment!)\n// This is just to show how you'd call the function.\n// You would typically get the username and password from a form submission.\n\n// Simulate a username and password\n$username = \"testuser\";\n$password = \"password123\";\n\nif (login($username, $password)) {\n    echo \"Login successful!

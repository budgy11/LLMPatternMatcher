However, *never* use this approach in other parts of your application where user-supplied data is used for other purposes.  Always use prepared statements (explained below) to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\n4. **Query Execution:**\n   - `$result = $conn->query($sql);` executes the SQL query.\n   - `$result->num_rows > 0` checks if any rows were returned by the query. If rows are returned, it means a user with the given username and password exists.\n\n5. **Authentication Success:**\n   - `$row = $result->fetch_assoc();` retrieves the first row of the result set as an associative array.  This array contains the data from the `users` table for the logged-in user.\n   - `$_SESSION['user_id'] = $row['id'];` and `$_SESSION['username'] = $row['username'];` store the user's ID and username in the `$_SESSION` superglobal.  `$_SESSION` is a PHP array that stores session data, allowing you to maintain user state across multiple pages.\n   - `echo \"Login successful! You are now logged in as \" . $_SESSION['username'];` displays a success message.\n   - `header(\"Location: /protected_page.php\");`  redirects the user to a protected page.  Replace `/protected_page.php` with the actual URL of your protected page.\n   - `exit();` terminates the script execution after the redirect, preventing any further code from running.\n\n6. **Authentication Failure:**\n   - `echo \"Invalid username or password.\";`  displays an error message if no user is found or if the credentials are incorrect.\n\n7. **Database Connection Closure:**\n   - `$conn->close();` closes the database connection to release resources.  It's important to close connections when you're done with them.\n\n**Important Security Considerations and Improvements:**\n\n* **Prepared Statements (Crucial):**  The code above is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  *Never* directly insert user input into your SQL queries.  Use prepared statements with parameterized queries.  This prevents malicious users from injecting SQL code into your database.  Here's an example of using prepared statements:\n\n   ```php\n   $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\");\n   $stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $username, $password); // \"ss\" indicates two strings\n   $stmt->execute();\n   $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n   if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n       // ...\n   } else {\n       // ...\n   }\n\n   $stmt->close();\n   ```\n\n   - `prepare()`:  Prepares the SQL query for execution.\n   - `bind_param()`:  Binds the variables `$username` and `$password` to the query placeholders (`?`).  The type of each variable (e.g., \"s\" for string, \"i\" for integer) is specified.\n   - `execute()`:  Executes the prepared statement.\n   - `get_result()`:  Retrieves the result set.\n   - `close()`: Closes the statement.\n\n* **Password Hashing:** **Never** store passwords in plain text in your database.  Instead, hash them using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.  bcrypt is a good choice because it's computationally expensive, making brute-force attacks much slower.\n\n   ```php\n   // Example (using password_hash - you need to set salt)\n   $password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n   // ... insert $password into the database\n   ```\n\n   When a user tries to log in, you'll compare the hashed password from the database with the hashed password entered by the user:\n\n   ```php\n   if (password_verify($password, $hashed_password_from_db)) {\n       // Login successful\n   } else {\n       // Login failed\n   }\n   ```\n\n* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user input (including username and password) on the server-side to prevent unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.  At a minimum, ensure that the username and password meet certain length requirements and character restrictions.\n\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  This limits the number of login attempts allowed within a certain time period.\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server, protecting user credentials during transmission.\n\n* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., database connection errors, invalid input).  Don't display detailed error messages to users in a production environment, as they can reveal sensitive information.\n\n* **Session Management:**  Use secure session management techniques.  Set the `session.cookie_secure` option in your `php.ini` to ensure that session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.  Use the `session_regenerate_id()` function to generate a new session ID after a user logs in, mitigating the risk of session fixation attacks.\n\nThis improved code provides a better starting point for a secure login function.  Remember to carefully implement all the security recommendations and adapt the code to your specific application requirements.

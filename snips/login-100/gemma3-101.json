Use environment variables instead.\n\n2.  **Form Submission Check:**\n    *   `if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") { ... }`  This ensures the code only runs when the form has been submitted, preventing unnecessary processing.\n\n3.  **Input Validation:**\n    *   `if (empty($username) || empty($password)) { ... }`  This is **critical for security**.  It checks that both fields are filled in.  Without this, an attacker could simply submit an empty form, which could be exploited.  It's a basic level of validation; you should also consider validating the format of the username and password to further enhance security.\n\n4.  **Database Connection:**\n    *   `$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);` Creates a MySQLi connection object.  `mysqli` is generally preferred over the older `mysql` extension.\n\n5.  **Connection Error Handling:**\n    *   `if ($conn->connect_error) { ... }`  Handles potential connection errors. It's important to display an error message to the user so they know something went wrong.\n\n6.  **SQL Query:**\n    *   `$sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'\";` This query retrieves user data from the `users` table based on the provided username and password. *Note the single quotes around `$username` and `$password`.  This is important for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities*.  However, be aware that if `$username` or `$password` contains characters like `'` or `\\` that are part of the SQL syntax, you might still have problems.  Use parameterized queries (as shown in the advanced example below) for the best protection.\n\n7.  **Result Processing:**\n    *   `if ($result->num_rows == 0) { ... }`  Checks if the query returned any results. If there are no results, the username or password is incorrect.\n    *   `if ($result->num_rows > 0) { ... }` If results are returned, the user is authenticated.\n\n8.  **Session Management:**\n    *   `$_SESSION[\"username\"] = $username;`  Sets a session variable `username` to store the authenticated user's username.  This allows you to keep track of the user's identity across multiple pages.  Session variables persist as long as the user is logged in.\n\n9.  **Redirection:**\n    *   `header(\"Location: /dashboard.php\");`  Redirects the user to a protected page (e.g., a dashboard) after successful login.  *Important:* You need to create the `dashboard.php` file.  Replace `/dashboard.php` with the actual path to your protected page.\n\n10. **`htmlspecialchars()`**: This function in the form tag prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by escaping special characters that could be interpreted as HTML.\n\n11. **Registration Link:** The `<p>Don't have an account? <a href=\"register.php\">Register</a></p>` creates a link to a registration page (you need to create a `register.php` file).\n\n**Security Considerations and Best Practices (VERY IMPORTANT):**\n\n*   **Parameterized Queries:**  The example uses string concatenation to build the SQL query. This is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. *Always* use parameterized queries to prevent this. Parameterized queries treat the user input as data, not as part of the SQL code, thus preventing malicious code from being executed.  Here's an example of how to use a parameterized query using prepared statements:\n\n```php\n$stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\");\n$stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $username, $password);  // \"ss\" means two strings\n$stmt->execute();\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\n\nif ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n  // ...\n}\n$stmt->close();\n```\n\n*   **Password Hashing:**  *Never* store passwords in plain text in your database.  Instead, you should hash them using a strong hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2).  bcrypt and Argon2 are specifically designed to be slow to compute, making them more resistant to brute-force attacks.\n*   **Salting:**  Always use a unique salt for each password. A salt is a random string that you concatenate with the password before hashing.  This makes it much harder for attackers to use precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.\n*   **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server. This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks.\n*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Limit the number of login attempts allowed within a certain time period.\n*   **Input Validation:**  Beyond just checking for empty fields, validate the format of the username and password (e.g., minimum length, allowed characters).\n*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to catch potential issues and prevent sensitive information from being exposed to the user.\n\n**Example with Password Hashing (using `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` - more secure):**\n\n```php\n// Example usage (on registration or login):\n$password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n$hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT); // Or PASSWORD_ARGON2I\n\n// ... store $hashed_password in your database\n\n// To verify the password during login:\n$password = $_POST[\"password\"];\nif (password_verify($password, $hashed_password)) {\n  // Password is correct\n} else {\n  // Incorrect password\n}\n```\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder database credentials and add appropriate error handling and security measures to protect your application. This comprehensive response provides a solid foundation for building a secure user login system.  Always prioritize security!  Consider using a well-established authentication library or framework for more complex applications.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database credentials (replace with your actual values)\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"your_username\";\n$password = \"your_password\";\n$dbname = \"your_database_name\";\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Get username and password from the form\n    $username = $_POST[\"username\"];\n    $password = $_POST[\"password\"];\n\n    // Validate input (important for security!)\n    if (empty($username) || empty($password)) {\n        $error = \"Username and password are required.\";\n    } else {\n        // Connect to the database\n        $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n        // Check connection\n        if ($conn->connect_error) {\n            die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        }\n\n        // SQL query to check credentials\n        $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'\";\n        $result = $conn->query($sql);\n\n        if ($result->num_rows == 0) {\n            $error = \"Invalid username or password.\";\n        }\n\n        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n            // User found, set session variables for authentication\n            $_SESSION[\"username\"] = $username;\n            echo \"Login successful!\";\n            // Redirect to a protected page or dashboard\n            header(\"Location: /dashboard.php\");  // Replace with your protected page\n            exit();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Display the login form if no form has been submitted\n?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Login Form</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Login</h1>\n\n    <?php if (isset($error)) {\n        echo \"<p style='color:red;'>$error</p>\";\n    } ?>\n\n    <form action=\"<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]); ?>\" method=\"post\">\n        Username: <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" required><br><br>\n        Password: <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" required><br><br>\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\">\n    </form>\n\n    <p>Don't have an account? <a href=\"register.php\">Register</a></p>  <!--  Link to registration page -->\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```", "```php\n$stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?

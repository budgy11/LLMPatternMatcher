{"prompt": "Create a user login function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user login function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that handling user logins involves checking the provided username and password against stored credentials in a database. So, I'll start by connecting to a MySQL database using mysqli because it's more secure and efficient than the older mysql functions.\n\nNext, I should consider security measures. SQL injection is a big risk here. To prevent that, I'll use prepared statements with parameterized queries. This means I'll prepare an SQL statement with placeholders and bind the username and password to these placeholders before executing the query. This way, user inputs are treated as data and not executable code.\n\nI also need to protect against brute force attacks. Implementing account locking after a certain number of failed attempts can help. I'll check how many failed attempts have occurred for each user and lock the account if it exceeds a predefined threshold, like 5 attempts. Additionally, adding a cooldown period between login attempts can slow down attackers.\n\nUsing password hashing is crucial to store passwords securely. PHP's built-in functions like password_hash() and password_verify() are designed for this purpose. I'll use these functions to hash the stored password and verify the user's input against it.\n\nSession management is another important aspect. After a successful login, I'll start a session and set some session variables like user ID, username, and login time. This helps in maintaining the user's state across different pages.\n\nI should also handle errors gracefully. If the login fails due to wrong credentials or an account being locked, I'll provide appropriate error messages. These messages will be displayed on the login page so the user knows what went wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the function step by step: connect to the database, check for existing failed attempts and apply cooldown if necessary, validate inputs, prepare and execute the SQL query with placeholders, verify the password, handle successful login with session setup, manage failed attempts by updating the database, and display relevant error messages.\n\nI also need to ensure that the function is user-friendly. Clear feedback through error messages helps users correct their mistakes without confusion.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the code is well-commented and organized for readability. This will help anyone reviewing or modifying the code in the future.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user login function using PHP with MySQL database connectivity and security best practices:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Import required functions\nrequire_once('database_connection.php');\n\nfunction user_login($username, $password) {\n    // Check if username and password are provided\n    if (empty($username) || empty($password)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Username and password are required\");\n    }\n\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = get_db_connection();\n\n    try {\n        // Prepare SQL statement to prevent SQL injection\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id, username, password, failed_attempts, last_attempt FROM users WHERE username = ?\");\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $username);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n        if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n            // Get user data\n            $user = $result->fetch_assoc();\n\n            // Check if account is locked due to too many failed attempts\n            if ($user['failed_attempts'] >= 5) {\n                throw new Exception(\"Account locked. Please wait \" . (3600 - time() + $user['last_attempt']) / 60 . \" minutes before trying again.\");\n            }\n\n            // Verify password\n            if (!password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {\n                // Update failed attempts\n                $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"UPDATE users SET failed_attempts = failed_attempts + 1, last_attempt = ? WHERE id = ?\");\n                $stmt->bind_param(\"si\", time(), $user['id']);\n                $stmt->execute();\n\n                throw new Exception(\"Incorrect password\");\n            }\n\n            // Reset failed attempts on successful login\n            $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"UPDATE users SET failed_attempts = 0, last_attempt = ? WHERE id = ?\");\n            $stmt->bind_param(\"si\", time(), $user['id']);\n            $stmt->execute();\n\n            // Start session and set user data\n            session_start();\n            $_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];\n            $_SESSION['username'] = $user['username'];\n            $_SESSION['login_time'] = time();\n\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            throw new Exception(\"Username not found\");\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Display error message\n        echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n        return false;\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        $conn->close();\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    try {\n        if (user_login($_POST['username'], $_POST['password'])) {\n            header(\"Location: dashboard.php\");\n            exit();\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        $error_message = $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis login function includes the following security features:\n\n1. **SQL Injection Prevention**:\n   - Uses prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\n\n2. **Account Locking**:\n   - Locks accounts after 5 failed attempts\n   - Implements a cooldown period before allowing another attempt\n\n3. **Password Hashing**:\n   - Stores passwords using PHP's `password_hash()` function\n   - Verifies passwords using `password_verify()`\n\n4. **Session Management**:\n   - Starts a session upon successful login\n   - Stores user data in the session\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - Provides meaningful error messages for users\n   - Handles exceptions properly\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Create a database connection file (`database_connection.php`) that contains your database credentials.\n\n2. Make sure to create a `users` table with the following columns:\n   - id (INT, PRIMARY KEY)\n   - username (VARCHAR)\n   - password (VARCHAR) - store hashed passwords here\n   - failed_attempts (INT)\n   - last_attempt (INT)\n\n3. When registering users, make sure to hash their passwords using `password_hash()` before storing them in the database.\n\n4. In your login form:\n   ```html\n   <form method=\"post\" action=\"<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]); ?>\">\n       <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\">\n       <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\">\n       <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n   </form>\n   ```\n\n5. Display error messages if any:\n   ```php\n   <?php if (isset($error_message)) { ?>\n       <div class=\"error\"><?php echo $error_message; ?></div>\n   <?php } ?>\n   ```\n\nRemember to:\n\n- Never store plain text passwords in the database.\n- Use HTTPS to secure data transmission between client and server.\n- Implement CSRF protection for your forms.\n- Regularly update your application and security libraries.\n\nYou can further enhance this code by adding features like:\n\n- Remember Me functionality\n- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n- Password strength validation\n- Email verification\n- Session timeout\n- Logout functionality", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Import required functions\nrequire_once('database_connection.php');\n\nfunction user_login($username, $password) {\n    // Check if username and password are provided\n    if (empty($username) || empty($password)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Username and password are required\");\n    }\n\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = get_db_connection();\n\n    try {\n        // Prepare SQL statement to prevent SQL injection\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id, username, password, failed_attempts, last_attempt FROM users WHERE username = ?\");\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $username);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n        if ($result->num_rows == 1) {\n            // Get user data\n            $user = $result->fetch_assoc();\n\n            // Check if account is locked due to too many failed attempts\n            if ($user['failed_attempts'] >= 5) {\n                throw new Exception(\"Account locked.

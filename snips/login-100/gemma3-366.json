It's crucial to understand the severe security implications of storing passwords in plain text.  This example is only for educational purposes.\n* **`password_verify()` for Secure Password Comparison:**  The code now uses `password_verify()` to properly check the password.  This function compares a provided password with a hashed version of the stored password. This is *essential* for security.\n* **Hashing with `password_hash()` (Important Reminder):**  To use `password_verify()`, you *must* hash the passwords when they are initially stored in the database using `password_hash()`. The example doesn't include this part, but it's a critical step.  This function creates a secure hash and a salt, which are then stored in the database.\n* **Session Management:**  The `session_start()` function is called to start a session.  Sessions are used to store user-specific information (like the username) after the user logs in. This is how you maintain the user's login status across multiple pages.\n* **Clearer Example Usage:** The example HTML form and PHP code snippet are more complete and illustrate how to use the `loginUser()` function within a real-world scenario.\n* **Error Handling:** The `else` block provides a basic error message (\"Invalid username or password.\")\n* **`exit()`:**  The `exit()` function is included after the redirect to prevent further script execution if the login is successful. This is good practice.\n* **Comments and Explanation:**  The code is heavily commented to explain each step.\n* **Database Simulation:**  The `$users` array is a simple simulation of a database.  In a real application, you would connect to your actual database and query for user information.\n\n**How to Use and Secure the Code:**\n\n1. **Replace the Database Simulation:** Replace the `$users` array with your actual database connection and query code.  You'll need to fetch the username and password from the database based on the provided username.\n\n2. **Hashing Passwords (Critical):** When a user registers (creates a new account), *immediately* hash the password using `password_hash()` and store the hash in your database.  Never store the plain-text password.\n\n   ```php\n   $password = $_POST['password']; // Get password from form\n   $hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT); // Hash the password\n   // Now, $hashedPassword is stored in the database.\n   ```\n\n3. **`password_verify()` for Login:**  When the user attempts to log in, retrieve the hashed password from the database and use `password_verify($enteredPassword, $hashedPassword)` to compare it to the entered password.\n\n4. **Input Validation:**  Always validate the username and password *before* attempting to login.  This prevents common attacks like SQL injection.  Use prepared statements when interacting with the database to prevent SQL injection.\n\n5. **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent attackers from forging login requests.\n\n6. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks (attempts to guess passwords).\n\n7. **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the user's browser and your server, protecting passwords in transit.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Beyond this Example):**\n\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Use prepared statements with your database queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n* **Salting:** The `password_hash()` function automatically generates a salt, which is a random string added to the password before hashing.  Don't try to manually manage salts.\n* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, character types, etc.).\n* **Regular Security Audits:**  Regularly audit your code for security vulnerabilities.\n* **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**  Keep your PHP version and all libraries up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis improved answer provides a much more secure and practical foundation for building a user login system in PHP, while also emphasizing the crucial security considerations that *must* be followed in a real-world application. Remember, security is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix.

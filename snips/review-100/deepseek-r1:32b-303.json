{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to outline what features are essential for a review system. Typically, users should be able to leave reviews and ratings, view existing ones, and have an average rating displayed. So, the function should handle displaying reviews, submitting new ones, calculating averages, and maybe handling different stars.\n\nI'll start by considering the database setup. I'll need tables for users and reviews. The reviews table should include user ID, review text, rating, and timestamps. This way, each review is tied to a specific user, preventing multiple submissions if needed.\n\nNext, the PHP functions. One function will handle displaying all reviews. It should fetch data from the database, format the date, calculate the average rating, and present everything neatly. Another function will handle submitting new reviews, checking for submission validity, inserting into the database, and showing success or error messages.\n\nFor security, I'll make sure to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Also, input validation is crucial\u2014checking that ratings are within 1-5 stars and that the review text isn't empty.\n\nI should also think about how to display the reviews. Each review will show the user's name, their comment, the rating as stars, and the date. The average rating can be a decimal number formatted to one place.\n\nTesting is important. I'll need to make sure that submitting a review works correctly, displays immediately after submission, and handles errors like empty fields or invalid ratings.\n\nI might also consider adding some CSS styling to make the reviews look nice, especially for the star ratings. But since the user asked for PHP functions, I'll focus on that part but mention that front-end work is needed too.\n\nFinally, putting it all together, the main function will call display_reviews(), and when a review is submitted, submit_review() handles it. The page should reload to show the new review, which means after submission, it redirects back or reloads the same page.\n\nI think covering these points should give the user a solid foundation for implementing a review system on their website.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for handling user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"myDB\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction display_reviews() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // SQL query to fetch all reviews\n    $sql = \"SELECT users.username, reviews.review_text, reviews.rating, reviews.review_date \n            FROM reviews \n            JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.user_id \n            ORDER BY review_date DESC\";\n            \n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    \n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        // Display average rating\n        $average_rating = calculate_average_rating();\n        echo \"<h3>Overall Rating: \" . number_format($average_rating, 1) . \"/5</h3>\";\n        \n        // Display each review\n        while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h4>Written by: \" . $row[\"username\"] . \"</h4>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . $row[\"review_text\"] . \"</p>\";\n            display_stars($row[\"rating\"]);\n            echo \"<small>Posted on: \" . date('F j, Y', strtotime($row[\"review_date\"])) . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews available yet.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating\nfunction calculate_average_rating() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n    return $row[\"average\"];\n}\n\n// Function to display stars based on rating\nfunction display_stars($rating) {\n    for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n        if ($i <= $rating) {\n            echo \"<span class='star'>\u2605</span>\";\n        } else {\n            echo \"<span class='star'>\u2606</span>\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to handle review submission\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $review_text, $rating) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Validate input\n    if (empty($review_text) || !isset($rating)) {\n        return \"Please fill in all required fields.\";\n    }\n    \n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5 stars.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, review_text, rating, review_date)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n            \n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"iss\", $user_id, $review_text, $rating);\n    \n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error: \" . $stmt->error;\n    }\n}\n\n// Close database connection\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\nThis code provides the following functionality:\n\n1. `display_reviews()`: Displays all user reviews in descending order of submission, showing:\n   - Review author (username)\n   - Review text\n   - Star rating\n   - Date posted\n\n2. `calculate_average_rating()`: Calculates and returns the average rating from all reviews.\n\n3. `display_stars($rating)`: Displays a star rating using \u2605 for filled stars and \u2606 for empty stars.\n\n4. `submit_review($user_id, $review_text, $rating)`: Handles new review submissions:\n   - Validates input\n   - Inserts review into database\n   - Returns success or error messages\n\nTo use this system:\n\n1. Users must be logged in to submit reviews (you'll need to implement user authentication)\n\n2. When a user submits a review through an HTML form, call `submit_review()` with the user's ID, their review text, and rating.\n\n3. Call `display_reviews()` on your product/service page to show all reviews and the average rating.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Replace the database connection details (servername, username, password, dbname) with your actual database information\n\n2. Make sure you have tables set up for users and reviews:\n   - users table should contain user_id and username\n   - reviews table should contain review_id, user_id, review_text, rating, review_date\n\n3. Add CSS styling to make the reviews look good (you can add classes like 'review', 'star' etc.)\n\nExample usage:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// On your product/service page:\ndisplay_reviews();\n\n// After form submission:\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    $result = submit_review($_SESSION['user_id'], $_POST['review_text'], $_POST['rating']);\n    echo $result;\n}\n?>\n```\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation and you might want to add additional features like:\n\n- Review editing/deletion for users\n- Sorting reviews by helpfulness or date\n- Flagging inappropriate reviews\n- Loading more reviews as the user scrolls (infinite scroll)\n- Translations and localization\n- Spam prevention measures\n\nRemember to always sanitize and validate user input, and use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"myDB\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction display_reviews() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // SQL query to fetch all reviews\n    $sql = \"SELECT users.username, reviews.review_text, reviews.rating, reviews.review_date \n            FROM reviews \n            JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.user_id \n            ORDER BY review_date DESC\";\n            \n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    \n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        // Display average rating\n        $average_rating = calculate_average_rating();\n        echo \"<h3>Overall Rating: \" . number_format($average_rating, 1) . \"/5</h3>\";\n        \n        // Display each review\n        while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h4>Written by: \" . $row[\"username\"] . \"</h4>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . $row[\"review_text\"] . \"</p>\";\n            display_stars($row[\"rating\"]);\n            echo \"<small>Posted on: \" . date('F j, Y', strtotime($row[\"review_date\"])) . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews available yet.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating\nfunction calculate_average_rating() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n    return $row[\"average\"];\n}\n\n// Function to display stars based on rating\nfunction display_stars($rating) {\n    for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n        if ($i <= $rating) {\n            echo \"<span class='star'>\u2605</span>\";\n        } else {\n            echo \"<span class='star'>\u2606</span>\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to handle review submission\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $review_text, $rating) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Validate input\n    if (empty($review_text) || !isset($rating)) {\n        return \"Please fill in all required fields.\";\n    }\n    \n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5 stars.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, review_text, rating, review_date)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n            \n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"iss\", $user_id, $review_text, $rating);\n    \n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error: \" . $stmt->error;\n    }\n}\n\n// Close database connection\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```", "```php\n<?php\n// On your product/service page:\ndisplay_reviews();\n\n// After form submission:\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    $result = submit_review($_SESSION['user_id'], $_POST['review_text'], $_POST['rating']);\n    echo $result;\n}\n?>\n```"]}

Error handling is included.\n    * **`file_put_contents()` for Appending:** Uses `file_put_contents()` with `FILE_APPEND` to add new reviews to the end of the file, preventing data loss.\n    * **Error Handling:** Includes `error_log()` for better debugging. Critically, it checks the return values of `file_put_contents()` and `file()` to see if the operations were successful.\n* **Data Validation and Sanitization:**\n    * **Type Casting:**  The code explicitly casts `$productId` to an integer using `(int)`. This prevents potential errors if the input is a string.\n    * **Input Validation (Basic):** Includes a basic check to ensure the username and comment are not empty strings.  *Crucially*, more robust input validation and sanitization would be needed for a production application to prevent security vulnerabilities like code injection.\n* **Review Retrieval:** The `getReviews()` function now correctly parses the file content to extract reviews for a given product ID, matching the formatting of the added reviews. Uses `strpos()` to find the reviews for the specified ID, enhancing accuracy.\n* **Delete Reviews Function:** Implemented a `deleteReviews()` method to remove reviews for a specific product.\n* **Clearer Example Usage:** The example usage is expanded to demonstrate adding and retrieving reviews, and then deleting them.\n* **Comments and Documentation:**  The code is thoroughly commented to explain the purpose of each section and function.\n* **Robustness:** Handles cases where the reviews file doesn't exist or errors occur during file operations.  It also checks return values to ensure operations are successful.\n* **Security Considerations (Important Note):** This example uses a simple text file.  **In a real-world application, you *must* use a database** (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) to store the reviews.  This file-based approach is vulnerable to security risks (e.g., unauthorized access to the file system).\n\n**To use this code:**\n\n1. Save it as a `.php` file (e.g., `review_manager.php`).\n2. Run it from your web server (e.g., `php review_manager.php`).\n\nThis improved version provides a solid foundation for a basic review system and highlights the key aspects of file handling, data storage, and basic error handling in PHP.  Remember to adapt and expand this code for your specific requirements.  And most importantly, *always* use a database and proper security measures in a production environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function - PHP\n * \n * This function allows you to store and retrieve user reviews for a given product.\n * It uses a simple file-based storage for demonstration purposes.  \n * \n * **Important:** In a real-world application, you would likely use a \n * database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) for storing data, \n * rather than files.

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they're looking for. A review system typically involves allowing users to leave reviews and ratings for something, like a product or service. So, the function should probably handle both the review text and the rating.\n\nI should start by considering the database structure. The reviews will need to be stored somewhere. Maybe a table called 'reviews' with fields like review_id, user_id, product_id, rating, comment, and timestamp. That makes sense because each review is linked to a specific user and product, has a numerical rating, a text comment, and when it was created.\n\nNext, I'll need functions to add a review, retrieve reviews, calculate the average rating, and maybe delete or update them. But since the user specifically mentioned a review function, I'll focus on adding and displaying for now.\n\nFor adding a review, the function should take parameters like user_id, product_id, rating, and comment. Then, it would insert these into the database. I should use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, which is good practice.\n\nWhen retrieving reviews, the function might need to fetch all reviews for a specific product. It could also calculate the average rating on the fly or have a separate function for that. The average rating is useful for displaying stars or overall feedback.\n\nDisplaying the reviews would involve formatting them in HTML. Maybe each review shows the user's name, their comment, the star rating, and the date they posted it. I can create another function to handle this display, which keeps things organized.\n\nI should also think about error handling. What if a user tries to post an invalid rating? The add_review function should check that the rating is between 1 and 5. If not, return an error message.\n\nSecurity is important too. Sanitizing inputs, using prepared statements, and ensuring that only authenticated users can leave reviews. Maybe adding a check for whether the user has already reviewed the product to prevent multiple submissions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Create the database table 'reviews' with necessary fields.\n2. Write an add_review function that inserts into this table after validation.\n3. Implement get_reviews and get_average_rating functions to retrieve data.\n4. Develop display_reviews to show all reviews for a product, including formatting stars and user info.\n5. Add error handling and input validation throughout.\n\nI should also consider how to handle the star display. Converting the numerical rating into visual stars can be done with CSS or HTML entities. For example, 4 stars would be four filled circles and one empty.\n\nTesting each function is crucial. After writing add_review, I'll test it by inserting a review and checking if it appears in the database. Similarly, test retrieving reviews to ensure they display correctly on the front end.\n\nDocumentation is another aspect. The code should include comments explaining what each function does, especially for someone else who might read it later.\n\nFinally, think about scalability. If the product has many reviews, pagination might be necessary. But that's beyond the initial scope, so maybe leave it as a future enhancement.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll draft the functions step by step, making sure each part is modular and easy to integrate into a larger application.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review system in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"myDB\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to add a review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Validate input\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating. Rating must be between 1 and 5.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Sanitize comment\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars(strip_tags(trim($comment)));\n    \n    // Check for empty comment\n    if (empty($comment)) {\n        return \"Comment cannot be empty.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Prepare and execute the SQL statement\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, review_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\");\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"iisi\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n    \n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return \"Review added successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error adding review: \" . $stmt->error;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to get reviews for a product\nfunction get_reviews($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $reviews = array();\n    \n    // Get all reviews for the product\n    $result = $conn->query(\"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = $product_id ORDER BY review_date DESC\");\n    \n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            $reviews[] = array(\n                'review_id' => $row['review_id'],\n                'user_id' => $row['user_id'],\n                'rating' => $row['rating'],\n                'comment' => htmlspecialchars_decode($row['comment']),\n                'date' => $row['review_date']\n            );\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return $reviews;\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating for a product\nfunction get_average_rating($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $result = $conn->query(\"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews WHERE product_id = $product_id\");\n    \n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        $row = $result->fetch_assoc();\n        return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews in HTML format\nfunction display_reviews($product_id) {\n    $reviews = get_reviews($product_id);\n    $average_rating = get_average_rating($product_id);\n    \n    if (empty($reviews)) {\n        echo \"<p>No reviews yet.</p>\";\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // Display average rating\n    echo \"<div class='average-rating'>\";\n    echo \"<h3>Average Rating: \" . $average_rating . \" / 5</h3>\";\n    echo \"</div>\";\n    \n    // Display each review\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n        echo \"<div class='rating'>\";\n        // Display stars based on rating\n        for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n            if ($i <= $review['rating']) {\n                echo \"<span class='star'>\u2605</span>\";\n            } else {\n                echo \"<span class='star'>\u2606</span>\";\n            }\n        }\n        echo \"</div>\";\n        echo \"<p><strong>Review by:</strong> User ID: \" . $review['user_id'] . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<p>\" . nl2br($review['comment']) . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<p class='date'><small>Posted on: \" . date('M j, Y g:i a', strtotime($review['date'])) . \"</small></p>\";\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Close database connection\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\nThis code provides the following functionality:\n\n1. `add_review()`: Allows users to submit reviews with ratings (1-5) and comments.\n\n2. `get_reviews()`: Retrieves all reviews for a specific product.\n\n3. `get_average_rating()`: Calculates and returns the average rating for a product.\n\n4. `display_reviews()`: Displays reviews in an HTML format, showing:\n   - Average rating\n   - Star ratings for each review\n   - User comments\n   - Posting date\n\nTo use this system:\n\n1. Create a database table named 'reviews' with the following structure:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    review_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT NOT NULL,\n    product_id INT NOT NULL,\n    rating TINYINT NOT NULL,\n    comment TEXT NOT NULL,\n    review_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n2. Add a form on your product page where users can submit their reviews:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"submit_review.php\" method=\"POST\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"product_id\" value=\"<?php echo $product_id; ?>\">\n    \n    <div class=\"rating-stars\">\n        <p>Rating:</p>\n        <select name=\"rating\">\n            <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n            <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n            <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n            <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n            <option value=\"5\" selected>5 Stars</option>\n        </select>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"comment-section\">\n        <textarea name=\"comment\" placeholder=\"Write your review here...\" required></textarea>\n    </div>\n\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n3. In `submit_review.php`, add the following code:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Include the review functions\ninclude('review_functions.php');\n\n// Get form data\n$product_id = $_POST['product_id'];\n$rating = $_POST['rating'];\n$comment = $_POST['comment'];\n\n// Add the review and show feedback\necho add_review($_SESSION['user_id'], $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n// Redirect back to product page after short delay\nheader(\"Refresh: 2; url=product.php?id=$product_id\");\n?>\n```\n\n4. On your product pages, display reviews using:\n\n```php\n<?php include('review_functions.php'); ?>\n<div class=\"reviews-container\">\n    <?php display_reviews($product_id); ?>\n</div>\n```\n\nFeatures:\n- Input validation for ratings (must be between 1 and 5)\n- Comment sanitization to prevent XSS attacks\n- Display of star ratings\n- Timestamp tracking\n- Average rating calculation\n- Easy-to-read HTML output\n\nYou can customize the styling by adding CSS classes to the elements. For example:\n\n```css\n.review {\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\n    padding: 15px;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n}\n\n.star {\n    font-size: 24px;\n    color: gold;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to:\n- Add proper user authentication before allowing reviews\n- Handle database errors gracefully\n- Implement pagination for products with many reviews\n- Add CSRF protection when submitting forms", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"myDB\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to add a review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Validate input\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating.

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a PHP function for a user review system. Let me break down what the user is asking for.\n\nFirst, the function should handle submitting reviews and calculating the average rating. So, I'll need parameters for the user ID, product ID, rating, and optional comments.\n\nI'll start by connecting to the database using mysqli_connect. It's important to replace placeholders with actual credentials for security.\n\nNext, I should check if the user has already reviewed the product to prevent multiple submissions. A SELECT query will help here, checking both user_id and product_id in the reviews table.\n\nIf there's no existing review, I'll proceed to insert the new review into the database. This includes handling cases where comments might be null by converting them using mysqli_real_escape_string.\n\nAfter inserting, calculating the average rating is essential. I'll use a SELECT query with AVG(rating) on the product_id to get the average and update the products table accordingly.\n\nFinally, the function should return messages based on success or failure at each step: if the review was added, if there's an error, or if the user already reviewed.\n\nI also need to ensure proper escaping of strings to prevent SQL injection and include error handling with try-catch blocks for better debugging.\n\nTesting the function with example usage will help verify its correctness. I'll make sure to remind the user to replace database credentials and handle any exceptions that might occur.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for a user review system:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submitReview($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments = null) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $servername = \"localhost\";\n    $username = \"username\";\n    $password = \"password\";\n    $dbname = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    try {\n        // Create database connection\n        $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n        // Check if user already reviewed this product\n        $checkReviewQuery = \"\n            SELECT review_id \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE user_id = ? AND product_id = ?\n        \";\n        \n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($checkReviewQuery);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $user_id, $product_id);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n        if ($result->num_rows == 0) {\n            // Insert new review\n            $insertReviewQuery = \"\n                INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comments)\n                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\n            \";\n            \n            $stmt = $conn->prepare($insertReviewQuery);\n            $comments = ($comments === null) ? \"\" : mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comments);\n            $stmt->bind_param(\"iisi\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments);\n            $stmt->execute();\n\n            // Update average rating for the product\n            $updateAvgQuery = \"\n                UPDATE products \n                SET average_rating = (\n                    SELECT AVG(rating) \n                    FROM reviews \n                    WHERE product_id = ?\n                ) \n                WHERE product_id = ?\n            \";\n            \n            $stmt = $conn->prepare($updateAvgQuery);\n            $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $product_id, $product_id);\n            $stmt->execute();\n\n            return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n        } else {\n            // User already reviewed this product\n            return \"You have already reviewed this product.\";\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Handle any errors that occur\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        if ($conn != null) {\n            $conn->close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 101;\n$rating = 5;\n$comments = \"Great product! Highly recommend.\";\n\n$result = submitReview($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments);\necho $result;\n\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database\n2. Checks if the user has already reviewed the product\n3. Submits a new review if one doesn't exist\n4. Updates the average rating for the product\n5. Handles errors gracefully\n\nKey features:\n- Prevents multiple reviews from the same user for the same product\n- Maintains an average rating for each product\n- Includes error handling and database connection management\n- Secure against SQL injection using prepared statements\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Replace the database connection parameters ($servername, $username, etc.)\n2. Make sure your database has appropriate tables:\n   - `reviews` table with columns: review_id, user_id, product_id, rating, comments\n   - `products` table with a column for average_rating\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation and might need to be adapted based on your specific requirements. You should also add input validation and sanitization as needed.\n\nRemember to:\n- Handle database credentials securely\n- Add proper error handling in production code\n- Validate user inputs before processing\n- Implement rate limiting or other anti-abuse measures if necessary\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have questions!", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submitReview($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments = null) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $servername = \"localhost\";\n    $username = \"username\";\n    $password = \"password\";\n    $dbname = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    try {\n        // Create database connection\n        $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n        // Check if user already reviewed this product\n        $checkReviewQuery = \"\n            SELECT review_id \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE user_id = ?

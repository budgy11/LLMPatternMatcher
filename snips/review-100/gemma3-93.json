This prevents invalid data from being stored.\n* **Type Hinting:** Uses type hinting (e.g., `string $user`, `int $rating`) for better code clarity and to help catch errors during development.\n* **Clearer Function Names:** More descriptive function names (e.g., `getAllReviews`, `getReviewsForItem`, `getAverageRatingForItem`).\n* **`getReviewsForItem()`:** Added a function to get reviews for a specific item.  This is *crucial* for a real-world application.  The current implementation just returns *all* reviews for demonstration, but you'll need a proper system to link reviews to items (e.g., a database).\n* **Average Rating Calculation:** The `getAverageRatingForItem` function now accurately calculates the average rating.  It handles the case where there are no reviews (returns `null` in that case).\n* **`formatReview()` Function:** Added a function to format the review information for display (e.g., HTML output).  This is a common task.\n* **Example Usage:**  A complete example of how to use the `Review` class is included.\n* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the purpose of each function and section of code.\n* **Error Handling:**  Handles the situation where there are no reviews for a particular item.\n* **Return Values:** Each function returns a meaningful value (e.g., `true` on success, `false` on failure, `null` when no reviews exist).\n* **Database Integration (Placeholder):**  The code includes a comment indicating where you would typically integrate with a database to store and retrieve reviews.  This is a critical step for any real application.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `review.php`).\n2.  **Run from the command line:**  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Then run it using the PHP interpreter: `php review.php`\n3.  **Integration with a Database:** To make this code production-ready, you would need to:\n    *   Choose a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).\n    *   Install a database driver for PHP.\n    *   Create a database table to store reviews (with columns for `user`, `comment`, `rating`, and potentially an `item_id` to link the review to a product or service).\n    *   Modify the code to connect to the database, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the reviews table, and store the data in the database.\n\nThis improved version provides a much more robust and practical foundation for building a review system.  Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and database setup.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Class Review\n *\n * This class provides functionality to manage user reviews.\n */\nclass Review {\n\n    /**\n     * @var array Array of reviews.\n     */\n    private $reviews = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a new review to the reviews array.\n     *\n     * @param string $user  The name of the user who submitted the review.\n     * @param string $comment The content of the review.\n     * @param int $rating The rating (1-5).\n     * @return bool True on success, false on failure (e.g., invalid rating).\n     */\n    public function addReview(string $user, string $comment, int $rating): bool {\n        // Validate rating\n        if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        $this->reviews[] = [\n            'user' => $user,\n            'comment' => $comment,\n            'rating' => $rating\n        ];\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Gets all reviews.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of all reviews.\n     */\n    public function getAllReviews(): array {\n        return $this->reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Gets reviews for a specific item (e.g., product, service).\n     *\n     * @param mixed $item  The item to get reviews for.

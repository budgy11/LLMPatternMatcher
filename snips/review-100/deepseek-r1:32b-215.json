{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for. A review system typically involves allowing users to submit reviews and display them on a webpage. So, the function should handle both submitting new reviews and displaying existing ones.\n\nI'll start by outlining the steps needed. The function will probably take some parameters like the product ID, user name, rating, comment, and maybe a connection to the database. Then, it needs to insert this data into a MySQL database.\n\nWait, but in PHP, functions can't directly output HTML unless they're designed to. So, perhaps after inserting the review, the function should also fetch all reviews for that product and return them as an array so they can be displayed elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the function just handles insertion, and another part of the code deals with displaying.\n\nHmm, but the user asked for a review function, which might imply both submission and display. So I'll include both functionalities. The function will insert the new review into the database and then retrieve all reviews for that product to display them.\n\nNext, I should consider security. User inputs can be risky, so I need to sanitize them to prevent SQL injection. Using mysqli_real_escape_string is a good start, but prepared statements would be even better. However, since the user didn't specify using OOP or PDO, I'll stick with procedural mysqli for simplicity.\n\nI also need to validate the input. The rating should be between 1 and 5. If it's outside this range, we throw an error. Also, the comment should have a minimum length; maybe 3 characters as a basic check.\n\nNow, structuring the function: It should connect to the database using mysqli_connect. Then, escape the inputs to prevent SQL injection. Check if all required fields are provided; otherwise, return an error.\n\nAfter inserting the review into the reviews table, I need to fetch all reviews for that product. That means selecting from the reviews table where product_id matches and joining with users if necessary, but in this case, since we're using user_name as a field, maybe it's stored directly in the reviews table or in a separate users table.\n\nWait, in the insert statement, I see user_name is included, so perhaps each review has a product_id, user_name, rating, and comment. So when fetching, I just need to select these fields where product_id matches.\n\nOnce retrieved, calculate the average rating by summing all ratings and dividing by the count of reviews. Then, return an array containing the average and an array of all reviews.\n\nIn the HTML part, loop through each review and display user name, star rating, comment, and date. Also, display a form where users can submit their own reviews. The form should POST to the same page or another script that calls this function.\n\nWait, but in the code I provided earlier, the function itself handles both insertion and display. That might not be the best practice because functions are usually meant for specific tasks. However, for simplicity, combining them into one function could make it easier for the user.\n\nI should also handle errors gracefully. If any part of the database operation fails, return an appropriate error message instead of crashing or exposing database details to the user.\n\nTesting is important too. After writing the code, test by submitting a review and checking if it appears correctly on the page. Also, ensure that invalid inputs are rejected and that security measures work as intended.\n\nFinally, I'll provide some notes on how to use the function, like connecting to the database, calling the function with the correct parameters, and displaying the reviews in an HTML template.\n</think>\n\nHere's a PHP function for creating a user review system:\n\n```php\nfunction createReview($product_id, $user_name, $rating, $comment, $db_connection) {\n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($db_connection, $product_id);\n    $user_name = mysqli_real_escape_string($db_connection, $user_name);\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($db_connection, $comment);\n\n    // Validate input\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating. Please choose a rating between 1 and 5 stars.\";\n    }\n    \n    if (strlen($comment) < 3) {\n        return \"Comment must be at least 3 characters long.\";\n    }\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $insert_review = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_name, rating, comment)\n                     VALUES ('$product_id', '$user_name', '$rating', '$comment')\";\n    \n    if (!mysqli_query($db_connection, $insert_review)) {\n        return \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($db_connection);\n    }\n\n    // Get all reviews for the product\n    $get_reviews = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = '$product_id'\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($db_connection, $get_reviews);\n\n    if (!$result) {\n        return \"Error fetching reviews: \" . mysqli_error($db_connection);\n    }\n\n    $reviews = array();\n    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        $reviews[] = array(\n            'user_name' => $row['user_name'],\n            'rating' => $row['rating'],\n            'comment' => $row['comment'],\n            'date_posted' => $row['date_posted']\n        );\n    }\n\n    // Calculate average rating\n    $total_ratings = count($reviews);\n    if ($total_ratings > 0) {\n        $sum_ratings = array_sum(array_column($reviews, 'rating'));\n        $average_rating = $sum_ratings / $total_ratings;\n    } else {\n        $average_rating = 0;\n    }\n\n    // Return the average rating and reviews\n    return array(\n        'average_rating' => number_format($average_rating, 1),\n        'reviews' => $reviews,\n        'success' => true\n    );\n}\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Takes parameters for product ID, user name, rating, comment, and database connection\n\n2. Sanitizes the inputs to prevent SQL injection\n\n3. Validates the input:\n   - Ensures rating is between 1-5 stars\n   - Checks that comment has at least 3 characters\n\n4. Inserts the new review into the database\n\n5. Retrieves all reviews for the product\n\n6. Calculates and returns the average rating\n\n7. Returns an array containing:\n   - The average rating (rounded to 1 decimal place)\n   - An array of all reviews\n   - Success status\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Connect to your MySQL database:\n\n```php\n$db_connection = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\n```\n\n2. Call the function when submitting a review:\n\n```php\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    $result = createReview(\n        $_POST['product_id'],\n        $_POST['user_name'],\n        $_POST['rating'],\n        $_POST['comment'],\n        $db_connection\n    );\n    \n    if (is_array($result)) {\n        // Success, reviews updated\n        $average_rating = $result['average_rating'];\n        $reviews = $result['reviews'];\n    } else {\n        // Error message\n        echo $result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. Display the reviews in your HTML:\n\n```php\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Product Reviews</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <?php if (isset($average_rating)): ?>\n        <h2>Average Rating: <?php echo $average_rating; ?> stars</h2>\n        \n        <?php foreach ($reviews as $review): ?>\n            <div class=\"review\">\n                <p><strong><?php echo $review['user_name']; ?></strong></p>\n                <p>Rating: <?php \n                    for ($i = 0; $i < $review['rating']; $i++) {\n                        echo \"\u2605\";\n                    }\n                ?></p>\n                <p><?php echo $review['comment']; ?></p>\n                <p><?php echo $review['date_posted']; ?></p>\n            </div>\n        <?php endforeach; ?>\n    <?php endif; ?>\n\n    <!-- Review Form -->\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"product_id\" value=\"<?php echo $product_id; ?>\">\n        \n        <p>Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"user_name\"></p>\n        <p>Rating: \n            <select name=\"rating\">\n                <option value=\"5\">5 stars</option>\n                <option value=\"4\">4 stars</option>\n                <option value=\"3\">3 stars</option>\n                <option value=\"2\">2 stars</option>\n                <option value=\"1\">1 star</option>\n            </select>\n        </p>\n        <p>Comment: <textarea name=\"comment\"></textarea></p>\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit Review\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nMake sure to:\n\n1. Create a database table named `reviews` with the following columns:\n   - id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)\n   - product_id (INT)\n   - user_name (VARCHAR)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - comment (TEXT)\n   - date_posted (DATETIME)\n\n2. Adjust the database connection details in `$db_connection`\n\n3. Include this function in your PHP code where you need to handle reviews\n\nThe system will allow users to:\n- Submit new reviews\n- See all existing reviews\n- View average rating\n- Rate products using stars\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation and you might want to add additional features like:\n- User authentication\n- Review moderation\n- Upvoting/downvoting\n- Reporting system\n- More detailed user profiles\n- CSS styling for better presentation\n- Error handling for database connections\n- Input validation on the client side", "code_blocks": ["```php\nfunction createReview($product_id, $user_name, $rating, $comment, $db_connection) {\n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($db_connection, $product_id);\n    $user_name = mysqli_real_escape_string($db_connection, $user_name);\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($db_connection, $comment);\n\n    // Validate input\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating.

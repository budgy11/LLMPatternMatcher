{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. Those are essential for submitting a review.\n\nNext, I should validate these inputs. Checking if all required fields are filled is important. Also, ensuring the rating is between 1 and 5 makes sense because ratings outside that range don't make much sense for typical reviews.\n\nThen, connecting to the database is necessary. Using mysqli for database connection is good since it's more secure than older methods. I'll need to include configuration settings from another file, maybe config.php, to keep things organized.\n\nAfter validation and database connection, inserting the data into the reviews table comes next. Using prepared statements with placeholders will help prevent SQL injection attacks, which is a security best practice.\n\nOnce inserted, updating the product's average rating is crucial. I'll calculate the new average by fetching the current total ratings and count, then compute the updated average. Rounding it to two decimal places keeps it neat.\n\nFinally, providing feedback to the user is important. If everything goes well, return a success message. If there are errors during validation or database operations, handle those gracefully and inform the user appropriately.\n\nI should also make sure the function is self-contained but reusable, maybe by including it in another file so other parts of the application can use it when needed.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for handling user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to create a user review\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Validate inputs\n    if (empty($user_id) || empty($product_id) || empty($rating) || empty($comment)) {\n        return \"All fields are required!\";\n    }\n\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5!\";\n    }\n\n    // Connect to database\n    include 'config.php'; // Include your database configuration\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, \"\n        INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment)\n        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\n    \");\n    \n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        return \"Database error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n\n    // Bind parameters\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iisi\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n    // Execute statement\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        // Update product average rating\n        $result = mysqli_query($conn, \"\n            SELECT \n                COUNT(rating) AS total_ratings,\n                AVG(rating) AS avg_rating\n            FROM reviews\n            WHERE product_id = $product_id\n        \");\n        \n        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        $avg_rating = round($row['avg_rating'], 2);\n\n        // Update product table with new average rating\n        mysqli_query($conn, \"\n            UPDATE products \n            SET average_rating = $avg_rating \n            WHERE id = $product_id\n        \");\n\n        return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_stmt_error($stmt);\n    }\n\n    // Close statement and connection\n    mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n    mysqli_close($conn);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$comment = \"This is a great product!\";\n\n$result = submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\necho $result;\n\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Takes user input for review (user ID, product ID, rating, and comment)\n2. Validates the input to ensure all fields are filled\n3. Checks that the rating is between 1-5\n4. Connects to a MySQL database\n5. Inserts the review into the reviews table\n6. Updates the average rating for the product in the products table\n7. Returns success or error messages\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Make sure you have a `config.php` file with your database connection details\n2. Create a `reviews` table in your database with columns: id, user_id, product_id, rating, comment, created_at\n3. Create a `products` table with at least an id and average_rating column\n\nExample tables:\n\n```sql\n-- reviews table\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    user_id INT NOT NULL,\n    product_id INT NOT NULL,\n    rating INT NOT NULL,\n    comment TEXT NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)\n);\n\n-- products table\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    description TEXT,\n    average_rating DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,\n    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\nYou can modify the function to include additional validation or features such as:\n\n- Sanitizing input\n- Checking if the user has already reviewed the product\n- Adding timestamps\n- Handling different types of errors\n- Implementing rate limiting\n- Adding CAPTCHA verification\n\nRemember to secure your database connection and handle any potential SQL injection attempts by using prepared statements (which are used in this example) and validating all user inputs.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Function to create a user review\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Validate inputs\n    if (empty($user_id) || empty($product_id) || empty($rating) || empty($comment)) {\n        return \"All fields are required!\";\n    }\n\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5!\";\n    }\n\n    // Connect to database\n    include 'config.php'; // Include your database configuration\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, \"\n        INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment)\n        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\n    \");\n    \n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        return \"Database error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n\n    // Bind parameters\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iisi\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n    // Execute statement\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        // Update product average rating\n        $result = mysqli_query($conn, \"\n            SELECT \n                COUNT(rating) AS total_ratings,\n                AVG(rating) AS avg_rating\n            FROM reviews\n            WHERE product_id = $product_id\n        \");\n        \n        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        $avg_rating = round($row['avg_rating'], 2);\n\n        // Update product table with new average rating\n        mysqli_query($conn, \"\n            UPDATE products \n            SET average_rating = $avg_rating \n            WHERE id = $product_id\n        \");\n\n        return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_stmt_error($stmt);\n    }\n\n    // Close statement and connection\n    mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n    mysqli_close($conn);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$comment = \"This is a great product!\";\n\n$result = submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\necho $result;\n\n?>\n```", null]}

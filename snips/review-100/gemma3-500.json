This prevents invalid data from being stored and causes errors down the line.\n* **`getAllReviews()` Method:**  Provides a simple way to retrieve all reviews from the system.\n* **`getReviewsByProduct()` Method (Placeholder):**\n    * Added a placeholder method to allow filtering reviews by product name. This is where you'll implement your specific filtering logic (e.g., by looking up product IDs in a database).\n* **`getAverageRating()` Method:** Calculates and returns the average rating from the reviews. It handles the case where there are no reviews to prevent division by zero.\n* **Comprehensive Example Usage:** The example code demonstrates:\n    * Creating a `UserReview` object.\n    * Adding reviews with different ratings and comments.\n    * Retrieving and displaying all reviews.\n    * Calculating the average rating.\n    * Filtering reviews by product (the placeholder is shown).\n* **Clear Comments and Docblocks:** The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each method and its parameters.  Docblocks are used for better documentation.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling by returning `false` from `addReview()` if input validation fails, and handles the case where there are no reviews when calculating the average rating.\n* **Scalability:**  This structure is designed to be easily extended. You can add features like:\n    * Storing reviews in a database.\n    * Adding more filtering options (e.g., by date, reviewer).\n    * Implementing pagination for displaying reviews.\n    * Authentication/Authorization for users to submit reviews.\n\nHow to Use and Extend:\n\n1.  **Save the Code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `user_review.php`).\n2.  **Include the File:** Include the file in your web application's code:  `require_once 'user_review.php';`\n3.  **Instantiate the Class:** Create an instance of the `UserReview` class: `$reviewSystem = new UserReview();`\n4.  **Add Reviews:** Use the `addReview()` method to add reviews: `$reviewSystem->addReview('User Name', 4, 'Your comment');`\n5.  **Retrieve and Display Reviews:** Use the methods to retrieve and display the reviews.\n\nRemember to adapt the example code to your specific needs and integrate it into your web application's logic.  The filtering part (`getReviewsByProduct`) is the most important part to customize based on your data structure.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Class UserReview\n *\n * Allows users to submit and view reviews for a product or service.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $reviews = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a new review.\n     *\n     * @param string $user  The name of the user who wrote the review.\n     * @param string $rating The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5 stars).\n     * @param string $comment The user's review text.\n     * @return bool True if the review was added successfully, false otherwise.\n     */\n    public function addReview($user, $rating, $comment) {\n        if (!is_string($user) || !is_string($comment)) {\n            return false; // Invalid input\n        }\n\n        if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            return false; // Invalid rating\n        }\n\n        $this->reviews[] = [\n            'user' => $user,\n            'rating' => $rating,\n            'comment' => $comment\n        ];\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all reviews.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of review objects.\n     */\n    public function getAllReviews() {\n        return $this->reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves reviews for a specific product or service (placeholder - extend as needed)\n     *\n     * @param string $productName (Optional)  Filter by product name\n     * @return array An array of review objects filtered by product name.

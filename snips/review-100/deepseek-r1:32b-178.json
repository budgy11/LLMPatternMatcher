{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants me to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what that entails.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements. The function should allow users to leave reviews with ratings and text. It should also handle displaying these reviews and calculating an average rating.\n\nI'll start by considering how to structure the data. Using arrays makes sense since they can hold multiple pieces of information for each review. Each review will have a user ID, username, rating, comment, and timestamp.\n\nNext, I need functions for adding reviews, retrieving them, and calculating the average. For adding, I'll create a function that appends a new review to the array. Retrieving can be another function that returns all stored reviews.\n\nCalculating the average is important. I'll write a function that sums all ratings and divides by the number of reviews. If there are no reviews, it should return zero to avoid division errors.\n\nDisplaying the reviews and average is part of the process too. So, I'll include a display function that shows each review with its details and the average rating formatted as stars.\n\nI also need to handle user input securely. Sanitizing inputs will prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks if this data is later stored in a database. For now, the functions just handle arrays, but it's good practice to mention sanitization.\n\nStoring reviews in a session might be temporary, so I'll note that for persistence, a database should be used. This way, the reviews remain between page reloads.\n\nTesting each function is crucial. I'll add test cases for adding a review, retrieving them, and calculating the average. This ensures everything works as expected before integration.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the code with clear function definitions and comments for better readability. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use these functions together.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review system in PHP that allows users to submit reviews, displays reviews, and calculates average ratings:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Initialize an empty array to store reviews if it doesn't exist\nif (!isset($_SESSION['reviews'])) {\n    $_SESSION['reviews'] = [];\n}\n\n/**\n * Add a new user review\n * @param string $userId The unique identifier of the user\n * @param int $rating The rating (1-5)\n * @param string $comment The review comment\n */\nfunction addReview($userId, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $_SESSION;\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $userId = htmlspecialchars($userId);\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars($comment);\n\n    // Validate rating is between 1 and 5\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Create review array\n    $review = [\n        'user_id' => $userId,\n        'username' => $_SESSION['username'], // Assuming user has a session\n        'rating' => $rating,\n        'comment' => $comment,\n        'timestamp' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')\n    ];\n\n    // Add review to the reviews array\n    $_SESSION['reviews'][] = $review;\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n/**\n * Get all reviews\n * @return array Array of reviews\n */\nfunction getReviews() {\n    global $_SESSION;\n    return $_SESSION['reviews'];\n}\n\n/**\n * Calculate average rating\n * @return float Average rating\n */\nfunction calculateAverageRating() {\n    global $_SESSION;\n    \n    $ratings = array_column($_SESSION['reviews'], 'rating');\n    $count = count($ratings);\n\n    if ($count == 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    return number_format(array_sum($ratings) / $count, 1);\n}\n\n/**\n * Display reviews and average rating\n */\nfunction displayReviews() {\n    $averageRating = calculateAverageRating();\n    $reviews = getReviews();\n\n    // Display average rating\n    echo \"<div class='average-rating'>\";\n    echo \"Average Rating: $averageRating/5\";\n    echo \"</div>\";\n\n    // Display all reviews\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n        echo \"<h4>By {$review['username']}</h4>\";\n        echo \"<p>Rating: \" . str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $review['rating']) . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<p>Comment: {$review['comment']}</p>\";\n        echo \"<small>Posted on: {$review['timestamp']}</small>\";\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// Assuming user is logged in and has a session\nif (isset($_POST['submit_review'])) {\n    $userId = $_SESSION['user_id'];\n    $rating = $_POST['rating'];\n    $comment = $_POST['comment'];\n\n    if (addReview($userId, $rating, $comment)) {\n        echo \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error: Please enter a rating between 1 and 5.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Display reviews\ndisplayReviews();\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes:\n\n1. A session-based storage system for reviews (you should eventually move this to a database)\n\n2. Functions:\n   - `addReview()`: Adds a new review with user ID, rating, and comment\n   - `getReviews()`: Retrieves all stored reviews\n   - `calculateAverageRating()`: Calculates the average rating from all reviews\n   - `displayReviews()`: Displays all reviews and the average rating\n\n3. Input validation:\n   - Ensures ratings are between 1-5\n   - Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks\n\n4. Example usage of submitting a review and displaying reviews\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Make sure sessions are started at the beginning of your script with `session_start()`\n\n2. When submitting a review, ensure you have:\n   - A logged-in user with session data\n   - Proper form validation for ratings (1-5)\n\n3. Add appropriate HTML styling to make the reviews look good\n\nRemember that this is a basic example and you should consider additional security measures like:\n\n- Database storage instead of session storage\n- Input validation and sanitization\n- User authentication\n- SQL injection prevention if using a database\n- XSS attack prevention\n- Rate limiting to prevent abuse\n\nYou can extend this code by adding features like:\n- Review editing/deletion for users\n- Sorting reviews by most recent or highest rated\n- Displaying number of total reviews\n- Allowing users to sort reviews in different ways\n- Adding reply functionality for customer support", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Initialize an empty array to store reviews if it doesn't exist\nif (!isset($_SESSION['reviews'])) {\n    $_SESSION['reviews'] = [];\n}\n\n/**\n * Add a new user review\n * @param string $userId The unique identifier of the user\n * @param int $rating The rating (1-5)\n * @param string $comment The review comment\n */\nfunction addReview($userId, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $_SESSION;\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $userId = htmlspecialchars($userId);\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars($comment);\n\n    // Validate rating is between 1 and 5\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Create review array\n    $review = [\n        'user_id' => $userId,\n        'username' => $_SESSION['username'], // Assuming user has a session\n        'rating' => $rating,\n        'comment' => $comment,\n        'timestamp' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')\n    ];\n\n    // Add review to the reviews array\n    $_SESSION['reviews'][] = $review;\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n/**\n * Get all reviews\n * @return array Array of reviews\n */\nfunction getReviews() {\n    global $_SESSION;\n    return $_SESSION['reviews'];\n}\n\n/**\n * Calculate average rating\n * @return float Average rating\n */\nfunction calculateAverageRating() {\n    global $_SESSION;\n    \n    $ratings = array_column($_SESSION['reviews'], 'rating');\n    $count = count($ratings);\n\n    if ($count == 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    return number_format(array_sum($ratings) / $count, 1);\n}\n\n/**\n * Display reviews and average rating\n */\nfunction displayReviews() {\n    $averageRating = calculateAverageRating();\n    $reviews = getReviews();\n\n    // Display average rating\n    echo \"<div class='average-rating'>\";\n    echo \"Average Rating: $averageRating/5\";\n    echo \"</div>\";\n\n    // Display all reviews\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n        echo \"<h4>By {$review['username']}</h4>\";\n        echo \"<p>Rating: \" . str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $review['rating']) . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<p>Comment: {$review['comment']}</p>\";\n        echo \"<small>Posted on: {$review['timestamp']}</small>\";\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// Assuming user is logged in and has a session\nif (isset($_POST['submit_review'])) {\n    $userId = $_SESSION['user_id'];\n    $rating = $_POST['rating'];\n    $comment = $_POST['comment'];\n\n    if (addReview($userId, $rating, $comment)) {\n        echo \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error: Please enter a rating between 1 and 5.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Display reviews\ndisplayReviews();\n?>\n```"]}

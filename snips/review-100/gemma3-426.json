It's crucial to initialize all properties.  The `$reviewId` is optional with a default value of `null`, so you can create reviews without an ID initially.\n* **Getters and Setters:**  Provides access to the review's data using getter methods (`get...()`) and allows modification of the data using setter methods (`set...()`).  This is good object-oriented practice, allowing you to control how the data is accessed and changed.  Important: add validation in a production environment.\n* **Date Handling:** The `date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\")` function ensures that the date and time are stored in a standard format.  This is extremely important for sorting and comparing reviews.\n* **`displayReview()` Method:** A simple method to display the review information, helpful for testing and demonstration.\n* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to create and use `UserReview` objects.\n* **Comments and Documentation:**  Includes comprehensive comments to explain the code.\n* **Error Handling (Mentioned):** The code comments explicitly highlight the need for error handling and input validation in a real-world application.\n* **Extensibility:** The comments at the end detail the steps to take to turn this into a full review system by connecting it to a database and adding more functionality (e.g.,  search, pagination, moderation).\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `reviews.php`).\n2.  **Run:**  Place the file in your web server's document root and access it through your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/reviews.php`).  You'll see the example reviews displayed.\n\nTo integrate this into a larger application, you would:\n\n1.  **Database Integration:**  Use a database connection library (like PDO) to connect to your database.\n2.  **Store Reviews:** Modify the constructor to save the review data to the database.\n3.  **Retrieve Reviews:** Create methods to retrieve reviews from the database based on criteria (e.g., product ID, user ID, rating).\n4.  **Validation:** Add validation logic to ensure that the input data is valid (e.g., rating is within a specific range, comment is not empty, etc.).  This prevents invalid data from being stored in the database.\n5.  **Security:**  Implement security measures, such as input sanitization and output encoding, to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n6.  **User Interface:**  Create a user interface (e.g., HTML form) to allow users to submit reviews.  The form data would be processed to create and save `UserReview` objects.\n\nThis improved version provides a solid foundation for building a user review system in PHP. Remember to add error handling, validation, and security measures for a production-ready application.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $reviewId;\n    private $userId;\n    private $productId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * @param int $reviewId (optional) - Unique identifier for the review.

This makes the code reusable and easier to understand.\n* **Type Hinting:**  Uses type hinting (`string`, `array`) for function parameters. This enforces that the correct data types are passed in, improving code reliability and readability.  It also helps PHP to catch errors early on.\n* **Docblock Comment:**  Includes a comprehensive Docblock comment explaining the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. This is crucial for documentation and understanding the code's functionality.\n* **Error Handling (Empty Review List):**  Handles the case where there are no reviews.  It displays a user-friendly message (\"No reviews yet.\") instead of an empty list, which is a much better user experience.\n* **HTML Formatting:**  Generates properly formatted HTML for a clean and visually appealing display.  Uses CSS classes (e.g., `review-container`, `review-list`, `review-item`) to allow for easy styling with CSS.  This is extremely important for making the reviews look good on a webpage.\n* **Data Structure:** The `reviews` array is structured as an array of associative arrays, each representing a single review.  This is a common and efficient way to represent related data in PHP.\n* **String Interpolation:** Uses string interpolation (`{$productName}`, `{$review['author']}`) for cleaner and more readable string concatenation.\n* **Example Usage:**  Provides a clear example of how to use the function, including sample data.\n* **Output:**  Demonstrates how to call the function and display the resulting HTML.\n* **Security:**  This version *does not* include any sanitization or escaping of user input.  **Important:** If you're displaying user-provided reviews in a web application, you *must* sanitize the `$comment` and `$author` values to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  Use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` to escape special characters.\n\nHow to use and expand this code:\n\n1. **Include in your PHP page:**  Copy and paste the code into your PHP file.\n2. **Populate `$reviews`:**  Replace the sample `$reviews` array with your actual review data.  This data should come from a database, API, or other source.\n3. **Call the function:**  Call `displayUserReviews($productName, $reviews)` and use the returned HTML in your page.\n4. **Style with CSS:** Create a CSS file and link it to your HTML page to style the reviews.  Use the CSS classes you defined in the function.\n5. **Add Features:** You can easily add features like:\n   - Pagination (if you have many reviews)\n   - Sorting reviews (e.g., by rating, date)\n   - Allow users to submit new reviews (using a form)\n   - Implement user authentication and authorization to control who can submit reviews.\n6. **Security (Critical!):**  Always sanitize user input before displaying it in your HTML.\n\n```php\n// Example of sanitization (replace with your chosen method):\n$safeComment = htmlspecialchars($review['comment'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n```\n\nThis improved version is a robust and well-structured foundation for building a user review display system in your PHP application.

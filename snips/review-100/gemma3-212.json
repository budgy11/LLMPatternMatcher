This is much better than manually storing the date string.\n* **`displayReview()` Method:** A convenient method to output the review information in a readable format.\n* **`displayUserReviews()` Function:** This function now accepts an array of `UserReview` objects and iterates through them, displaying each review. It makes the code more modular and reusable.  Importantly, it uses `$review->displayReview()` to print the data.\n* **Example Usage:**  A clear example is provided showing how to create `UserReview` objects and then display them.\n* **Modular Design:** The code is designed in a modular way with a class and a function to handle the review process.\n* **Code Comments:** Added code comments for better understanding.\n* **HTML Output:** The `displayReview()` method includes HTML markup (divs and hr tags) to visually organize the reviews. You can easily adapt this to your specific web framework.\n* **Error Handling (Important Consideration - Not Included Here):**  In a real-world application, you'd need to add error handling. For example, you'd want to validate the rating to ensure it's within a valid range (1-5 in this example).  You'd also want to prevent malicious input.\n* **Database Interaction (Not Included Here):**  This example is purely for demonstration. In a real application, you would typically store the reviews in a database.  The class would likely need to have methods to save and retrieve reviews from the database.\n\nHow to extend this:\n\n* **Database Integration:**  Modify the class to save and retrieve reviews from a database (using MySQLi, PDO, or another database library).\n* **Input Validation:**  Implement input validation to ensure the rating is a valid number and that the comment is not too long.\n* **Authentication/Authorization:**  If you're allowing users to leave reviews, you'll need to implement authentication and authorization to verify that the user is allowed to leave a review for that product.\n* **Sorting/Filtering:**  Add functionality to sort reviews by rating, date, or other criteria.  Add filtering options (e.g., show only 5-star reviews).\n* **Web Framework Integration:**  Adapt the code to work with a specific web framework (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter) to take advantage of its features and conventions.\n\nThis improved version provides a solid foundation for creating a user review system.  Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n *\n * This class allows you to store and manage user reviews for a product or item.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $reviewId;\n    private $productId;\n    private $userId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes a new UserReview object.\n     *\n     * @param int $productId The ID of the product being reviewed.\n     * @param int $userId    The ID of the user leaving the review.\n     * @param int $rating    The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The user's comment about the product.\n     */\n    public function __construct($productId, $userId, $rating, $comment) {\n        $this->productId = $productId;\n        $this->userId = $userId;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->date = date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); // Current timestamp\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Getters\n     */\n    public function getReviewId() {\n        return $this->reviewId;\n    }\n\n    public function getProductId() {\n        return $this->productId;\n    }\n\n    public function getUserId() {\n        return $this->userId;\n    }\n\n    public function getRating() {\n        return $this->rating;\n    }\n\n    public function getComment() {\n        return $this->comment;\n    }\n\n    public function getDate() {\n        return $this->date;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *  Example method to display review info\n     */\n    public function displayReview() {\n        echo \"Review ID: \" . $this->getReviewId() . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Product ID: \" . $this->getProductId() . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"User ID: \" . $this->getUserId() . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Rating: \" . $this->getRating() . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Comment: \" . $this->getComment() . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Date: \" . $this->getDate() . \"<br>\";\n    }\n}\n\n\n/**\n * User Review Review Function (Simple Example)\n */\nfunction displayUserReviews($reviews) {\n    echo \"<h2>User Reviews</h2>\";\n\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n        $review->displayReview(); // Display the review information\n        echo \"</div><hr>\";\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n// Example Usage:\n\n// Create some sample reviews\n$review1 = new UserReview(123, 456, 5, \"Great product!

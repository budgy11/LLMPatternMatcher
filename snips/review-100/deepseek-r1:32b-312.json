{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, the user asked to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. Probably, they want a way to allow users to leave reviews and ratings on their website. So, I should break this down into manageable parts.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the database setup. The function will need to interact with a database, so I'll outline the necessary tables: one for storing reviews and another for tracking votes. Each review should have an ID, user details, product ID, rating, comment, and timestamps. The vote table needs IDs for both users and reviews to track who has voted on which review.\n\nNext, connecting to the database is essential. I'll use mysqli_connect since it's more secure and efficient than older methods. Including error handling here is important so the user knows if something goes wrong with the connection.\n\nNow, onto the core function: submitting a review. This function should check if the user has already reviewed the product to prevent multiple entries. If not, it inserts the new review into the database. I'll include placeholders for variables like $conn, $userId, $productId, etc., so the user can adapt them to their own setup.\n\nVoting functionality is another key part. Users should be able to upvote or downvote reviews. The function needs to check if the user has already voted on that review and update accordingly. This involves updating both the vote count and ensuring each vote is only counted once per user.\n\nDisplaying the reviews is necessary for users to see others' opinions. I'll write a query to fetch all reviews for a specific product, order them by rating, and include the count of upvotes. The display should show user details, review content, rating stars, upvote button, vote count, and timestamp.\n\nConsidering security, I need to remind the user about using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Also, validating input is crucial to avoid malicious data entry.\n\nFinally, I'll think about additional features that might be useful, like allowing edits or deletions of reviews, implementing a reporting system, pagination for long lists, and handling anonymous users if needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the function should cover submission, voting, display, and include necessary security measures. I'll structure the code with clear sections for each part and provide comments to guide the user on where to insert their specific variables and connections.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review system in PHP that allows users to submit, display, and vote on reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"reviews\";\n\n$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Create review table if not exists\n$sql = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reviews (\n    id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT(6),\n    product_id INT(6),\n    rating INT(2),\n    comment TEXT,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n)\";\n\nmysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n// Create votes table if not exists\n$sql = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS review_votes (\n    id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT(6),\n    review_id INT(6),\n    vote_type ENUM('up', 'down'),\n    voted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n)\";\n\nmysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n// Function to submit a review\nfunction submitReview($conn, $userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n    $checkQuery = \"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ?

Database setup with two tables:\n   - `reviews` table to store review information\n   - `review_votes` table to track user votes\n\n2. Functions:\n   - `submitReview()`: Allows users to submit reviews\n   - `voteOnReview()`: Handles up/down voting on reviews\n   - `displayReviews()`: Displays all reviews for a specific product\n\n3. Security considerations:\n   - Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n   - Checks for existing votes before allowing new ones\n\n4. Features:\n   - Rating system (1-5 stars)\n   - Upvote/Downvote functionality\n   - Review submission and display\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Replace the database connection details (`$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, `$dbname`) with your actual database information.\n\n2. Include this file in your project where you need review functionality.\n\n3. Call the functions as needed:\n   - Use `submitReview()` when users submit a new review\n   - Use `voteOnReview()` when users vote on existing reviews\n   - Use `displayReviews()` to show all reviews for a specific product\n\n4. Add JavaScript and CSS as needed to style the reviews and handle the voting functionality.\n\nRemember to:\n\n- Sanitize user input before inserting into your database\n- Implement user authentication before allowing reviews or votes\n- Handle errors appropriately in production code\n- Add validation for rating values (1-5)\n- Consider adding timestamps and user information display\n\nYou might also want to add additional features like:\n- Review editing/deletion\n- Reporting system for inappropriate reviews\n- Anonymous reviews option\n- Sorting/reordering reviews\n- Pagination for long review lists", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"reviews\";\n\n$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Create review table if not exists\n$sql = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reviews (\n    id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT(6),\n    product_id INT(6),\n    rating INT(2),\n    comment TEXT,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n)\";\n\nmysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n// Create votes table if not exists\n$sql = \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS review_votes (\n    id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT(6),\n    review_id INT(6),\n    vote_type ENUM('up', 'down'),\n    voted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n)\";\n\nmysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n// Function to submit a review\nfunction submitReview($conn, $userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n    $checkQuery = \"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ?

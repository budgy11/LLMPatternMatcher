This is crucial for maintainability and reusability.\n* **`addReview()` Function:**  Adds a new review to the `$reviews` array.\n* **`getAllReviews()` Function:**  Retrieves all reviews for display or other operations.\n* **`getReviewsByRating()` Function:** Demonstrates filtering reviews based on a rating. *Crucially, it includes a placeholder where you would integrate your actual rating data.*  The example shows where and how to modify this function.\n* **`displayReviews()` Function:**  Formats and displays the reviews in an HTML unordered list (`<ul>`) for easy viewing.  It uses `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by escaping the user-provided text before displaying it in the HTML.  This is essential for security.\n* **Security (XSS Protection):**  The `htmlspecialchars()` function is *absolutely critical*. Without it, malicious users could inject JavaScript code into your website through the review text.\n* **HTML Output:**  Generates basic HTML for displaying the reviews.  You'll likely want to customize this to fit your website's design.\n* **Example Usage:**  Provides a clear example of how to create a `Review` object, add reviews, and display them.\n* **Comments and Documentation:** Includes comments to explain the purpose of each function and the code's logic.\n* **Error Handling (Minimal):** While this example doesn't include extensive error handling, a production-ready system would need to handle situations like invalid rating inputs.\n* **Scalability Considerations (Not Implemented):** For a large number of reviews, this simple array-based approach might not be efficient.  A database would be necessary for storing and retrieving reviews.  I've highlighted this in the comments.\n* **Database Integration (Not Implemented):**  To make this truly production-ready, you would need to replace the in-memory `$reviews` array with a database connection.\n* **Flexibility:** The code is designed to be easily extended to support additional features, such as:\n    * Rating input\n    * User authentication\n    * Moderation features (flagging inappropriate reviews)\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1. **Copy and Paste:**  Copy the entire code into a PHP file (e.g., `review.php`).\n2. **Run:**  Place the file in your web server's document root and access it through your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/review.php`).\n3. **Adapt:** Modify the code to:\n    * Replace the in-memory reviews with database interactions.\n    * Customize the HTML output to match your website's design.\n    * Add rating input to the form.\n    * Implement more sophisticated filtering and display options.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a well-structured, secure, and customizable PHP review system.  It's a solid starting point for building a more robust review application.  Remember to consider database integration and scalability for real-world applications.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Class Review\n *\n * Handles user reviews, allowing users to submit and display reviews.\n */\nclass Review {\n\n    private $reviews = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a new review to the database.\n     *\n     * @param string $user_name The name of the user who submitted the review.\n     * @param string $review_text The text of the review.\n     */\n    public function addReview(string $user_name, string $review_text) {\n        $this->reviews[] = ['user' => $user_name, 'text' => $review_text];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all reviews.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of review objects.\n     */\n    public function getAllReviews() {\n        return $this->reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves reviews based on a given criteria (e.g., maximum rating).\n     *\n     * @param int $rating The minimum rating to filter by (e.g., 4 or higher).\n     * @return array An array of review objects that meet the criteria.\n     */\n    public function getReviewsByRating(int $rating) {\n        $filteredReviews = [];\n        foreach ($this->getAllReviews() as $review) {\n            // You would typically have a rating field in your review objects.\n            // This is just an example.

This is *crucial* for managing review data.  It encapsulates data (the review itself) and operations (like getting or setting data).  This makes the code much more maintainable and extensible.\n* **Clear Data Structure:**  The class uses private properties to store the review information. This enforces data encapsulation \u2013 prevents direct modification of the review data from outside the class, which helps maintain data integrity.\n* **Constructor:** The `__construct()` method is the constructor.  It's called when you create a new `UserReview` object.  It initializes all the review properties with the provided values.  It also gets the current date and time and stores it.\n* **Getters:** The `get...()` methods are getter functions.  They allow you to *read* the values of the review properties.  This is good practice \u2013 it gives you controlled access to the data.\n* **Date Handling:**  The `date('Y-m-d H:i:s')` function is used to get the current date and time in a standard format.  Storing the date is essential for tracking review history.\n* **`displayUserReview()` Function:**  This function demonstrates how to *use* the `UserReview` object. It takes a `UserReview` object as input and displays its information. It includes a check `instanceof` to make sure you're actually working with a `UserReview` object.\n* **Error Handling/Validation:** The `displayUserReview` function includes a check to make sure the input is a `UserReview` object, and prints an error message if it's not.  This prevents unexpected errors and improves the robustness of your code.\n* **Clear Example Usage:** The code provides a clear example of how to create `UserReview` objects and how to display their information.\n* **Maintainability:**  The code is well-structured and documented, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.\n* **Scalability:** The class design makes it easy to add more review properties or functions (e.g., storing reviews in a database).\n\n**How to expand this further (important for a real application):**\n\n1. **Database Integration:**\n   - Instead of storing reviews in memory, you'll want to store them in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).\n   - The `UserReview` class would then use database queries to create, read, update, and delete reviews.\n\n2. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**\n   -  Before storing a review, you *must* validate and sanitize the user input (e.g., rating, comment). This prevents SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Authentication and Authorization:**\n   -  You'll need to implement authentication (verifying the user's identity) and authorization (determining what the user is allowed to do).\n\n4. **Review Ranking/Aggregation:**\n   -  You might want to calculate average ratings for products or rank reviews based on helpfulness.\n\n5. **Pagination:**\n   -  If you have a large number of reviews, you'll need to implement pagination to display them in smaller chunks.\n\n6. **User Interface (UI):**  This code only provides the backend logic. You'll need to create a web form or other UI to allow users to submit reviews.\n\nThis improved answer provides a solid foundation for a user review system.  Remember to prioritize security and data validation in any real-world implementation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n *\n * This class handles the creation, storage, and retrieval of user reviews.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $reviewId;\n    private $userId;\n    private $productId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes a new UserReview object.\n     *\n     * @param int $userId    The ID of the user submitting the review.\n     * @param int $productId The ID of the product being reviewed.\n     * @param int $rating    The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The user's review comment.\n     */\n    public function __construct($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n        $this->userId = $userId;\n        $this->productId = $productId;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->date = date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); // Current timestamp\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Getters\n     *\n     * Returns the values of the review properties.\n     *\n     * @return mixed\n     */\n    public function getReviewId() {\n        return $this->reviewId;\n    }\n\n    public function getUserId() {\n        return $this->userId;\n    }\n\n    public function getProductId() {\n        return $this->productId;\n    }\n\n    public function getRating() {\n        return $this->rating;\n    }\n\n    public function getComment() {\n        return $this->comment;\n    }\n\n    public function getDate() {\n        return $this->date;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     *  Setter for reviewId (optional, typically only set during storage)\n     *  @param int $reviewId\n     */\n    public function setReviewId($reviewId) {\n        $this->reviewId = $reviewId;\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n/**\n * User Review Review Function -  A basic function to simulate a user review functionality.\n * This is more of a demonstration and can be expanded significantly.\n */\nfunction displayUserReview($review) {\n    if ($review instanceof UserReview) {\n        echo \"<h2>Review for Product ID: \" . $review->getProductId() . \"</h2>\";\n        echo \"<p><strong>User ID:</strong> \" . $review->getUserId() . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<p><strong>Rating:</strong> \" . $review->getRating() . \" / 5</p>\";\n        echo \"<p><strong>Comment:</strong> \" . $review->getComment() . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<p><strong>Date:</strong> \" . $review->getDate() . \"</p>\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Invalid Review Object.

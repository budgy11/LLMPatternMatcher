{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. That makes sense because each review is tied to a specific user and product, and includes their feedback.\n\nNext, I should connect to the database. Using mysqli is a good choice here since it's more secure than older methods. I'll need to include the database credentials, so I'll define constants for them at the top of the script.\n\nOnce connected, I have to insert the review into the reviews table. The SQL query should include placeholders for each parameter to prevent SQL injection. Using prepared statements with bind_param is essential here.\n\nAfter inserting, it's a good idea to check if the insertion was successful. If not, return an error message so the user knows something went wrong.\n\nThen, I need a way to display these reviews on a product page. So, another function that fetches all reviews for a given product ID. Again, using mysqli to query the database and join with the users table to get the username.\n\nFormatting each review into an array with user name, rating stars, comment, date, and maybe the user's profile link if needed. Converting the date from MySQL format to something more readable is important for display purposes.\n\nI should also handle cases where there are no reviews yet by returning an empty array or a message indicating that.\n\nTesting is crucial. I'll need to make sure that all parameters are correctly handled, database connections work, and the output formatting looks good on the front end.\n\nSecurity considerations: Using prepared statements, sanitizing inputs where necessary, ensuring that only allowed HTML tags are used if comments can include markup, but in this case, maybe it's better to strip out any HTML to prevent XSS attacks unless we want users to format their comments with limited HTML.\n\nError handling is also important. Catching exceptions and providing meaningful error messages so the application doesn't crash and users get useful feedback.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the code by creating a class for reviews, including methods for submitting and fetching reviews. This makes the code organized and reusable in different parts of the application.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database configuration\ndefine('DB_HOST', 'localhost');\ndefine('DB_USER', 'username');\ndefine('DB_PASS', 'password');\ndefine('DB_NAME', 'database_name');\n\nclass Review {\n    private $conn;\n\n    public function __construct() {\n        // Connect to database\n        $this->conn = new mysqli(DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME);\n        \n        if ($this->conn->connect_error) {\n            die(\"Connection failed: \" . $this->conn->connect_error);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Function to submit a review\n    public function submitReview($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n        try {\n            // Prepare and bind the statement\n            $stmt = $this->conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\");\n            $stmt->bind_param(\"iids\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n            \n            // Execute the statement\n            if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                return true; // Review submitted successfully\n            } else {\n                return false; // Error submitting review\n            }\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Function to fetch reviews for a product\n    public function getReviews($product_id, $limit = 5) {\n        try {\n            $reviews = array();\n\n            // Prepare and bind the statement\n            $stmt = $this->conn->prepare(\"SELECT r.*, u.username FROM reviews r INNER JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id WHERE product_id = ?

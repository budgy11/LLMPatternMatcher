{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user asked to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. They probably want a way for users to leave reviews on their website and store those reviews in a database.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the main components needed. There should be an HTML form where users can input their name and review. Then, when they submit, the data needs to be processed by PHP. So, I'll need a function that handles the submission.\n\nI should consider security aspects. Sanitizing inputs is crucial to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks. Using functions like htmlspecialchars and mysqli_real_escape_string would help with that.\n\nNext, connecting to the database. The function will need to connect to a MySQL database where the reviews are stored. I'll include placeholders for the database credentials so the user can replace them with their own.\n\nStoring the review involves inserting into a table. I should make sure to include fields like id, username, review, and submission date. Using prepared statements or parameterized queries would be better for security, but since this is a basic example, using mysqli_query directly might be simpler for now.\n\nAfter storing the review, redirecting the user back to the form makes sense so they don't see the raw data after submission. Plus, adding a thank you message improves user experience.\n\nThen, displaying the reviews. Another function can fetch all reviews from the database and display them in HTML. Formatting each review with username, content, and date submitted will make it readable.\n\nI should also include error handling for the database connection to inform the user if something goes wrong, either by echoing an error message or logging it.\n\nFinally, putting it all together: create a form that calls the submission function on submit, handle the data in PHP, store it, redirect, and display the reviews elsewhere. I'll need to remind the user to set up their database table correctly and adjust the credentials as needed.\n\nI think covering these steps should give the user a complete solution for adding a review system to their website.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP that allows users to submit and display reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Configuration\n$dbHost = 'localhost';\n$dbUser = 'username';\n$dbPass = 'password';\n$dbName = 'database_name';\n\n// Connect to database\n$connection = mysqli_connect($dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName);\n\nif (!$connection) {\n    die(\"Database connection failed: \" . mysqli_error($connection));\n}\n\nfunction submitReview($username, $review, $connection) {\n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $username = htmlspecialchars(mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, trim($username)));\n    $review = htmlspecialchars(mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, trim($review)));\n\n    // Check if username and review are not empty\n    if (empty($username) || empty($review)) {\n        return \"Please fill in all fields!\";\n    }\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, review, submission_date)\n            VALUES ('$username', '$review', NOW())\";\n\n    if (mysqli_query($connection, $sql)) {\n        // Redirect back to the form after 1 second with a thank you message\n        header(\"Refresh: 1; url=reviews.php\");\n        echo \"Thank you for your review!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_error($connection);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction displayReviews($connection) {\n    // Fetch reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY submission_date DESC\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($connection, $sql);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>By \" . htmlspecialchars($row['username']) . \"</h3>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($row['review']) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<small>Submitted on: \" . $row['submission_date'] . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"<p>No reviews yet. Be the first to leave a review!</p>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($connection);\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes two main functions:\n\n1. `submitReview()`: Handles user input for submitting reviews.\n   - Sanitizes and validates inputs\n   - Inserts reviews into the database\n   - Redirects back to the form after submission\n\n2. `displayReviews()`: Retrieves and displays all stored reviews from the database.\n\nTo use this code, you'll need to:\n\n1. Set up a MySQL database table named `reviews` with the following structure:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    review TEXT NOT NULL,\n    submission_date DATETIME NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\n2. Create an HTML form for submitting reviews:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Submit Review</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <?php include 'review_function.php'; ?>\n\n    <h1>Submit a Review</h1>\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"username\">Name:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" required><br>\n\n        <label for=\"review\">Review:</label><br>\n        <textarea id=\"review\" name=\"review\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"40\" required></textarea><br>\n\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit Review\">\n    </form>\n\n    <?php\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n        $username = $_POST['username'];\n        $review = $_POST['review'];\n        submitReview($username, $review, $connection);\n    }\n    ?>\n\n    <h2>Latest Reviews</h2>\n    <?php displayReviews($connection); ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n3. Customize the database connection details in `review_function.php` to match your database setup.\n\nFeatures of this implementation:\n\n- Input sanitization and validation\n- Secure database operations\n- Error handling\n- Automatic redirect after submission\n- Display of reviews with username, content, and timestamp\n\nTo improve this basic implementation, you could add:\n\n1. User authentication\n2. Rating system (stars)\n3. Review moderation\n4. Editing/deleting reviews\n5. Sorting and filtering options\n6. Responsive design\n7. AJAX form submissions\n8. CAPTCHA verification to prevent spam\n\nRemember to secure your application by:\n- Using prepared statements or parameterized queries\n- Implementing proper error handling\n- Sanitizing all user inputs\n- Validating data before storing it in the database", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Configuration\n$dbHost = 'localhost';\n$dbUser = 'username';\n$dbPass = 'password';\n$dbName = 'database_name';\n\n// Connect to database\n$connection = mysqli_connect($dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName);\n\nif (!$connection) {\n    die(\"Database connection failed: \" . mysqli_error($connection));\n}\n\nfunction submitReview($username, $review, $connection) {\n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $username = htmlspecialchars(mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, trim($username)));\n    $review = htmlspecialchars(mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, trim($review)));\n\n    // Check if username and review are not empty\n    if (empty($username) || empty($review)) {\n        return \"Please fill in all fields!\";\n    }\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, review, submission_date)\n            VALUES ('$username', '$review', NOW())\";\n\n    if (mysqli_query($connection, $sql)) {\n        // Redirect back to the form after 1 second with a thank you message\n        header(\"Refresh: 1; url=reviews.php\");\n        echo \"Thank you for your review!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_error($connection);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction displayReviews($connection) {\n    // Fetch reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY submission_date DESC\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($connection, $sql);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>By \" . htmlspecialchars($row['username']) . \"</h3>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($row['review']) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<small>Submitted on: \" . $row['submission_date'] . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"<p>No reviews yet. Be the first to leave a review!</p>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($connection);\n?>\n```", null, null]}

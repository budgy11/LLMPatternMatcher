This is much more organized and maintainable than just a set of variables.\n* **Constructor:**  The `__construct()` method initializes the review object with the user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. Crucially, it also sets the date and time of the review using `date('Y-m-d H:i:s')`. This ensures that the review includes a timestamp.\n* **Getters:**  Provides `getUserId()`, `getProductId()`, `getRating()`, `getComment()`, and `getDate()` methods.  Getters are standard practice in object-oriented programming. They control how the values of the properties are accessed from outside the class.\n* **Display Method:** `displayReview()` method neatly formats the review data for display, making it easy to see all the information.\n* **Function to Create and Display:**  The `createAndDisplayReview()` function takes the necessary parameters, creates a `UserReview` object, and then calls the `displayReview()` method.  This encapsulates the logic for creating and displaying a review.\n* **Date Handling:** Includes the date and time of the review, which is crucial for tracking review history.  Uses the `date()` function for date formatting.\n* **Clear Comments:**  The code includes detailed comments to explain what each part does.\n* **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates how to use the `createAndDisplayReview()` function.\n* **Database Integration (Commented):** Includes a comment indicating where you would typically save the review to a database.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `reviews.php`).\n2.  **Run from command line:**  Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using `php reviews.php`. The output will be displayed on the console.\n3.  **Integrate into a web application:**\n    *   You would typically use this class within a web application framework (like Laravel, Symfony, or CodeIgniter) to handle user reviews.\n    *   You would use the `createAndDisplayReview()` function (or a similar function) to display a review on a webpage.\n    *   You would use a database connection to save the review data to a database.\n\nThis improved version provides a more robust and well-structured solution for managing user reviews in a PHP application.  It includes best practices for object-oriented programming, data handling, and code organization.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n * \n * Represents a user review for a product or item.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n    private $userId;\n    private $productId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * @param int $userId The ID of the user who wrote the review.\n     * @param int $productId The ID of the product being reviewed.\n     * @param int $rating The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The user's written review.\n     */\n    public function __construct($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n        $this->userId = $userId;\n        $this->productId = $productId;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->date = date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); // Set the date and time of the review\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Getters\n     */\n    public function getUserId() {\n        return $this->userId;\n    }\n\n    public function getProductId() {\n        return $this->productId;\n    }\n\n    public function getRating() {\n        return $this->rating;\n    }\n\n    public function getComment() {\n        return $this->comment;\n    }\n\n    public function getDate() {\n        return $this->date;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Display Review (for debugging/presentation)\n     *\n     * @return string  A formatted string representing the review.\n     */\n    public function displayReview() {\n        return \"User ID: \" . $this->getUserId() .\n               \"\\nProduct ID: \" . $this->getProductId() .\n               \"\\nRating: \" . $this->getRating() .\n               \"\\nComment: \" . $this->getComment() .\n               \"\\nDate: \" . $this->getDate();\n    }\n}\n\n/**\n * User Review Function (Example Usage)\n */\nfunction createAndDisplayReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Create a new review object\n    $review = new UserReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment);\n\n    // Display the review\n    echo $review->displayReview() . \"\\n\\n\";\n\n    // You could also save this review to a database here.\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage:\ncreateAndDisplayReview(123, 456, 5, \"Great product!

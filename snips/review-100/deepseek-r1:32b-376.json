{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. So, I'll define those as inputs.\n\nNext, I have to connect to the database. I remember using mysqli_connect before. I'll need the host, username, password, and database name. Oh, and I should handle any connection errors, maybe with a try-catch block.\n\nOnce connected, I'll prepare an SQL query to insert the review into the reviews table. Using prepared statements is better for security against SQL injection. So I'll use mysqli_prepare and bind the parameters.\n\nWait, what if there's an error in preparing the statement? I should check for that and handle it by throwing an exception or returning false with an error message.\n\nAfter executing the query, if affected rows are more than zero, it means the review was added successfully. Then, maybe return a success message.\n\nBut wait, after inserting, perhaps I need to fetch the new review ID or other details. So another query to select the last inserted review could be useful. Again, using prepared statements here too.\n\nIf that second query fails, I should handle it as well. Finally, close the database connection and return appropriate responses based on success or failure.\n\nI also need to make sure all variables are properly escaped and validated before processing. Maybe add some checks for empty inputs or invalid ratings (like ensuring rating is between 1 and 5).\n\nHmm, should I include error handling within the function? Yes, using try-catch to catch any exceptions and return an appropriate message.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will connect to the database, insert the review, check for success, fetch the new data if needed, handle errors, and then return a result indicating whether it worked or not.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that handles user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submitReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $dbUsername = \"username\";\n    $dbPassword = \"password\";\n    $dbName = \"database_name\";\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to database\n        $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n        \n        if (!$conn) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n        }\n\n        // Prepare SQL statement\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, review_date) \n                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n\n        $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);\n        \n        if (!$stmt) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n\n        // Bind parameters\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iisi\", $userId, $productId, $rating, $comment);\n\n        // Execute the statement\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n        \n        if ($result) {\n            // Get the last inserted review ID\n            $lastId = mysqli_insert_id($conn);\n\n            // Close the statement and connection\n            mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n            mysqli_close($conn);\n\n            return array(\n                \"status\" => \"success\",\n                \"message\" => \"Review submitted successfully!\",\n                \"review_id\" => $lastId\n            );\n        } else {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Close the statement and connection if any\n        if (isset($stmt)) {\n            mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n        }\n        if (isset($conn)) {\n            mysqli_close($conn);\n        }\n\n        return array(\n            \"status\" => \"error\",\n            \"message\" => $e->getMessage()\n        );\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Takes parameters for user ID, product ID, rating, and comment\n2. Connects to a MySQL database\n3. Prepares an SQL statement to insert the review into a table called 'reviews'\n4. Uses prepared statements with parameter binding to prevent SQL injection\n5. Handles errors using try-catch blocks\n6. Returns an array with either success or error status\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n```php\n// Example usage:\n$reviewResult = submitReview(1, 5, 4, \"Great product!\");\nprint_r($reviewResult);\n```\n\nThe function assumes you have a 'reviews' table in your database with the following columns:\n- review_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n- user_id (INT)\n- product_id (INT)\n- rating (INT)\n- comment (TEXT)\n- review_date (DATETIME)\n\nMake sure to modify the database connection details ($host, $dbUsername, etc.) and table/column names according to your actual database setup.\n\nYou might also want to add additional validation before submitting the review, such as:\n- Checking that all required fields are filled\n- Validating that rating is a number between 1 and 5\n- Sanitizing/sanitizing user input\n- Checking if the user already submitted a review for this product\n\nTo use this function in a real application, you should also consider implementing error handling in your front-end code to display appropriate messages to users.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submitReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $dbUsername = \"username\";\n    $dbPassword = \"password\";\n    $dbName = \"database_name\";\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to database\n        $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n        \n        if (!$conn) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n        }\n\n        // Prepare SQL statement\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, review_date) \n                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n\n        $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);\n        \n        if (!$stmt) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n\n        // Bind parameters\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iisi\", $userId, $productId, $rating, $comment);\n\n        // Execute the statement\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n        \n        if ($result) {\n            // Get the last inserted review ID\n            $lastId = mysqli_insert_id($conn);\n\n            // Close the statement and connection\n            mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n            mysqli_close($conn);\n\n            return array(\n                \"status\" => \"success\",\n                \"message\" => \"Review submitted successfully!\",\n                \"review_id\" => $lastId\n            );\n        } else {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Close the statement and connection if any\n        if (isset($stmt)) {\n            mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n        }\n        if (isset($conn)) {\n            mysqli_close($conn);\n        }\n\n        return array(\n            \"status\" => \"error\",\n            \"message\" => $e->getMessage()\n        );\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n// Example usage:\n$reviewResult = submitReview(1, 5, 4, \"Great product!\");\nprint_r($reviewResult);\n```"]}

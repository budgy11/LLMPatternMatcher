This is much more organized and scalable.\n* **Constructor:** The `Review` constructor now takes all the necessary data and automatically sets the `date_created` field to the current timestamp.\n* **Getters and Setters:**  Provides getter and setter methods for all the review properties. This is good practice for encapsulation and allows you to control how the review data is accessed and modified.\n* **`ReviewManager` Class:** This class handles the management of reviews.  It includes:\n    * `addReview()`: Adds a new review to the collection.\n    * `getReviewsByProduct()`:  Retrieves all reviews for a specific product.\n    * `updateReview()`:  Updates an existing review (simplified - needs validation in a real system).\n    * `deleteReview()`:  Deletes a review by ID.\n* **Date Handling:** Uses `date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\")` to get the current timestamp, which is standard and easily parsable.\n* **Example Usage:** Provides a complete example of how to use the classes, including creating reviews, retrieving reviews by product, updating a review, and deleting a review.\n* **Comments & Docblocks:** Includes detailed comments and docblocks to explain the code and its functionality.  This is essential for maintainability.\n* **Scalability:** This structure is much more scalable than a single large class. You can easily add more methods to the `ReviewManager` class to handle more complex operations (e.g., searching, sorting, pagination).\n* **Error Handling (Simplified):**  The `updateReview` and `deleteReview` methods return `true` or `false` to indicate success or failure.  A real system would have more robust error handling.\n* **Data Validation:** The `updateReview` method is *very* simplified.  A production system *must* include thorough data validation to prevent invalid data from being stored.  You'd want to check things like rating ranges, comment lengths, etc.\n* **Database Integration (Not Included):**  This code *does not* include database interaction. In a real application, you would connect to a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve the review data. You would use database queries to insert, update, and delete reviews.\n\n**How to Integrate with a Database (Conceptual):**\n\n1. **Database Connection:**  Use a database extension for PHP (e.g., `mysqli` or `PDO`) to connect to your database.\n2. **Create Tables:** Create two tables:\n   * `reviews`:\n     * `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n     * `user_id` (INT)\n     * `product_id` (INT)\n     * `rating` (INT)\n     * `comment` (TEXT)\n     * `date_created` (TIMESTAMP)\n   * `users` (If you don't have a separate users table, you could embed user information in the reviews table).\n3. **Database Queries:**  Modify the `ReviewManager` class to use database queries to interact with the tables.  Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nThis improved example provides a solid foundation for building a more complex review system. Remember to adapt it to your specific needs and implement proper data validation and security measures.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function\n *\n * This function allows you to create, read, update, and delete user reviews.\n * It provides a basic framework and can be customized further.\n */\n\nclass Review {\n    private $id;\n    private $user_id;\n    private $product_id;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date_created;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes a new Review object.\n     *\n     * @param int $user_id The ID of the user who wrote the review.\n     * @param int $product_id The ID of the product the review is for.\n     * @param int $rating The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The user's comment about the product.\n     */\n    public function __construct($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment)\n    {\n        $this->user_id = $user_id;\n        $this->product_id = $product_id;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->date_created = date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\"); // Get current timestamp\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     * Getters\n     */\n    public function getId() {\n        return $this->id;\n    }\n\n    public function getUser_id() {\n        return $this->user_id;\n    }\n\n    public function getProduct_id() {\n        return $this->product_id;\n    }\n\n    public function getRating() {\n        return $this->rating;\n    }\n\n    public function getComment() {\n        return $this->comment;\n    }\n\n    public function getDate_created() {\n        return $this->date_created;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Setters\n     */\n    public function setId($id) {\n        $this->id = $id;\n    }\n\n    public function setDate_created($date_created) {\n        $this->date_created = $date_created;\n    }\n\n}\n\n\n/**\n * User Review Function - Example Usage &  Some Basic Functions\n */\nclass ReviewManager {\n\n    private $reviews = [];  // Store reviews (for simplicity)\n\n    /**\n     * Add a review\n     *\n     * @param Review $review\n     */\n    public function addReview(Review $review) {\n        $this->reviews[] = $review;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get all reviews for a product\n     *\n     * @param int $product_id\n     * @return array An array of Review objects.\n     */\n    public function getReviewsByProduct($product_id) {\n        $results = [];\n        foreach ($this->reviews as $review) {\n            if ($review->getProduct_id() == $product_id) {\n                $results[] = $review;\n            }\n        }\n        return $results;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *  (Simplified) Update a review - in a real system, you'd likely want more robust validation.\n     * @param Review $review\n     */\n    public function updateReview(Review $review) {\n        // In a real application, you'd likely check for existing reviews\n        // and perform validation before updating.\n        foreach($this->reviews as $r) {\n            if($r->getId() == $review->getId()) {\n                $r->setDate_created(date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\")); // Update timestamp\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false; // Not found\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Delete a review\n     *\n     * @param int $id\n     * @return bool True if successful, false otherwise.\n     */\n    public function deleteReview($id) {\n        foreach ($this->reviews as $key => $review) {\n            if ($review->getId() == $id) {\n                unset($this->reviews[$key]);\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example Usage:\n$reviewManager = new ReviewManager();\n\n// Create a review\n$review1 = new Review(123, 456, 5, \"Great product!

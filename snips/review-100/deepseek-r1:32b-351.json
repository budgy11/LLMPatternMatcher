{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like review ID, user ID, rating, comment, and maybe a timestamp. These are essential for storing each review.\n\nNext, I'll connect to a MySQL database because it's commonly used and supports PHP well. Using mysqli is better than the older mysql functions since it's more secure and offers object-oriented features.\n\nI should start by establishing a database connection. I'll need to include config.php where the database credentials are stored. This keeps things organized and secure.\n\nThen, I'll prepare an SQL query to insert the new review into the reviews table. Using prepared statements with placeholders like ? helps prevent SQL injection, which is crucial for security.\n\nAfter executing the query, I should check if it was successful. If not, return an error message so the user knows something went wrong.\n\nIf everything works, maybe I want to display a success message or even fetch and return all reviews for immediate feedback. That way, after submitting, the user sees their review appear without reloading the page.\n\nI'll also include some example usage in HTML to show how it can be integrated into a form. This helps users understand how to implement the function correctly.\n\nWait, I should make sure the parameters have default values if they're optional. For instance, comment could be empty sometimes, so setting its default to an empty string makes sense.\n\nAlso, handling timestamps is important for tracking when reviews were made. Using NOW() in the SQL query ensures each review gets a current timestamp upon insertion.\n\nTesting is necessary. I should check different scenarios: adding a review with all fields, just rating and comment, without a comment, etc., to ensure it handles all cases correctly.\n\nFinally, error handling should be thorough. The function returns false on failure, which the calling code can check to display appropriate messages or take action.\n\nOverall, this function covers the basics of submitting a user review securely and efficiently. It's extensible too; if more features are needed later, they can be added without major changes.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that handles user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Connect to database\n$connection = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\nfunction submitReview($review_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment = \"\", $timestamp) {\n    global $connection;\n\n    // Validate input\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.\";\n    }\n\n    // Prepare SQL statement with placeholders for parameters\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (review_id, user_id, rating, comment, timestamp) \n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n\n    try {\n        // Create a prepared statement\n        $stmt = mysqli_prepare($connection, $sql);\n\n        // Bind the parameters to the statement\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"issis\", $review_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment, $timestamp);\n\n        // Execute the query\n        mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n\n        // Check if the query was successful\n        if (mysqli_stmt_affected_rows($stmt) == 1) {\n            // Return success message\n            return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n        } else {\n            // Return error message\n            return \"Error submitting review.\";\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Return error message if something goes wrong\n        return \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$review_id = 1;\n$user_id = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n$current_timestamp = date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\");\n\n$result = submitReview($review_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment, $current_timestamp);\necho $result;\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($connection);\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database\n2. Validates the input rating (must be between 1 and 5)\n3. Prepares an SQL statement using placeholders for security\n4. Binds the parameters to the prepared statement\n5. Executes the query\n6. Returns success or error messages\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Make sure your database is properly configured\n2. Update the database connection details in the `mysqli_connect()` call\n3. Create a table named \"reviews\" with appropriate columns:\n   - review_id (INT)\n   - user_id (INT)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - comment (TEXT)\n   - timestamp (DATETIME)\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Input validation for rating\n- SQL injection prevention using prepared statements\n- Error handling and informative error messages\n- Timestamp tracking for when the review was submitted\n\nYou can modify this function based on your specific requirements, such as adding additional fields or changing the database schema.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Connect to database\n$connection = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\nfunction submitReview($review_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment = \"\", $timestamp) {\n    global $connection;\n\n    // Validate input\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.\";\n    }\n\n    // Prepare SQL statement with placeholders for parameters\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (review_id, user_id, rating, comment, timestamp) \n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n\n    try {\n        // Create a prepared statement\n        $stmt = mysqli_prepare($connection, $sql);\n\n        // Bind the parameters to the statement\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"issis\", $review_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment, $timestamp);\n\n        // Execute the query\n        mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n\n        // Check if the query was successful\n        if (mysqli_stmt_affected_rows($stmt) == 1) {\n            // Return success message\n            return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n        } else {\n            // Return error message\n            return \"Error submitting review.\";\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Return error message if something goes wrong\n        return \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$review_id = 1;\n$user_id = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n$current_timestamp = date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\");\n\n$result = submitReview($review_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment, $current_timestamp);\necho $result;\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($connection);\n?>\n```"]}

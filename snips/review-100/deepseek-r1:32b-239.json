{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for a user review system. Let me think about what features this function should have.\n\nFirst, the basics: users should be able to leave reviews and ratings. So I'll need a form with a text area for comments and a way to select stars for rating. Maybe using radio buttons or a star selection interface.\n\nNext, how do I handle the submission? The form data needs to be sent to a PHP script when the user clicks submit. I should use POST method for that.\n\nNow, storing the reviews in a database makes sense. So I'll need to connect to a MySQL database and insert the review data into a table. The table should have fields like id, user_id, product_id, comment, rating, and timestamp.\n\nWait, how do I get the user_id? That depends on the authentication system. For now, maybe just simulate it with a fixed value or use a placeholder. But in a real application, I'd retrieve it from the session after login.\n\nWhat about validation? The review should have some content; an empty comment shouldn't be allowed. Also, the rating needs to be between 1 and 5. I'll add checks for these before inserting into the database.\n\nHandling errors is important too. If something goes wrong during insertion, like a connection failure or invalid data, I should display an error message. Maybe redirect back with an error flag so the user knows what happened.\n\nAfter successfully adding the review, it's good to show a success message. Perhaps redirect to the product page or reviews section with a message indicating the review was added.\n\nDisplaying the reviews is another part. Once submitted, they should appear on the relevant product page. So I'll need a separate function or code block that fetches all reviews for a given product and displays them.\n\nSecurity-wise, user inputs like comments could have SQL injection or XSS attacks. I must sanitize these inputs using mysqli_real_escape_string to prevent SQL injection. Also, consider HTML special characters to prevent XSS, but since comments are plain text, maybe just escaping is enough.\n\nWait, in the example code, when inserting into the database, $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['comment']); that's correct. And using prepared statements would be better for security, but I'll stick with basic functions for simplicity here.\n\nAlso, the star rating display: after a review is submitted, how to show the stars? Maybe in another part of the code, loop through 5 and mark filled based on the rating value. But that's more frontend work.\n\nI should also think about ordering the reviews. Probably by submission date, so the most recent appear first.\n\nTesting each part: make sure the form submits correctly, data is inserted into the database without errors, and then displayed properly.\n\nIn summary, the function will:\n\n1. Connect to the database.\n2. Validate user inputs (non-empty comment, valid rating).\n3. Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection.\n4. Insert review into the database.\n5. Handle success or error cases with appropriate feedback.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, let me structure the PHP code accordingly, making sure each step is clear and secure.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review system in PHP:\n\n**HTML Form (review_form.html):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Product Review</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Review Product</h1>\n    <form action=\"submit_review.php\" method=\"POST\">\n        <div>\n            <label for=\"comment\">Comment:</label><br>\n            <textarea id=\"comment\" name=\"comment\" rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\"></textarea>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <label>Rating:</label><br>\n            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"1\"> 1\n            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"2\"> 2\n            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"3\"> 3\n            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"4\"> 4\n            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"5\"> 5\n        </div>\n        <br>\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit Review\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Database Connection (db.php):**\n\n```php\n<?php\n$host = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"root\";\n$password = \"\";\n$dbname = \"reviews_db\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n?>\n```\n\n**Submit Review Script (submit_review.php):**\n\n```php\n<?php\ninclude_once('db.php');\n\n// Sanitize input data\n$comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['comment']);\n$rating = intval($_POST['rating']);\n\n// Validate inputs\nif ($comment == \"\" || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n    // Handle error: invalid inputs\n    die(\"Error: Please fill in all required fields and select a valid rating.\");\n}\n\n// Get product ID from somewhere (e.g., session or URL parameter)\n$product_id = intval($_GET['product_id']);\n$user_id = intval($_SESSION['user_id']);

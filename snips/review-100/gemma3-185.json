This makes the code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n* **Constructor:** The `__construct()` method initializes the review object with the necessary data.  It also sets the `reviewDate` to the current timestamp, ensuring that reviews are recorded with the date they were submitted.\n* **Getters:**  `getReviewData()` provides a clean way to access the review's data as an associative array. This is good practice for accessing protected or private properties.\n* **`formatReview()` Method:** This method formats the review data into a user-friendly string representation. This is extremely useful for displaying reviews on a website. It clearly labels each piece of information.\n* **Database Integration (Illustrative):**  The code includes a commented-out section that demonstrates how you would save the review data to a database (using MySQLi as an example).  *Important:* You'll need to adapt this section to your specific database system and framework.  This section is purely illustrative and requires you to set up your database connection and table structure.  Security is *critical* when working with databases, so be very careful about sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Use prepared statements (as shown in the example) to avoid this risk.\n* **Date Formatting:**  The `reviewDate` is now correctly formatted to be a string in a standard Y-m-d H:i:s format.\n* **Error Handling (Database Example):**  The database example includes basic error handling (checking for connection errors and executing statement errors).\n* **Comments and Documentation:**  The code is thoroughly commented to explain the purpose of each part.\n* **Clear Example Usage:**  The example demonstrates how to create a `UserReview` object, access its data, and format it for display.\n* **Prepared Statements (Database Example):** The example database integration code uses prepared statements, which is *crucial* for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Prepared statements separate the query structure from the data, ensuring that user-supplied data is treated as data and not as part of the SQL query.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1.  **Copy the code** into a PHP file (e.g., `review.php`).\n2.  **Adjust the database connection details** in the database integration section to match your database setup.\n3.  **Create the `reviews` table** in your database, with columns to store `product_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `comment`, and `review_date`.\n4.  **Uncomment** the database integration code if you want to save reviews to the database.\n5.  **Run the PHP file** from your web server.\n\nThis improved response provides a much more robust and practical solution for managing user reviews in PHP. Remember to implement proper security measures (especially when handling user input and database interactions) to protect your application.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function\n *\n * This function allows you to store and display user reviews for a product or item.\n * It includes basic validation and formatting for improved readability.\n */\n\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $productId;\n    private $userId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $reviewDate;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes a new UserReview object.\n     *\n     * @param int $productId The ID of the product or item being reviewed.\n     * @param int $userId The ID of the user submitting the review.\n     * @param int $rating   The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5 stars).\n     * @param string $comment The user's comment/feedback.\n     */\n    public function __construct(int $productId, int $userId, int $rating, string $comment) {\n        $this->productId = $productId;\n        $this->userId = $userId;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->reviewDate = date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); // Set review date to current timestamp\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Getters\n     *\n     * Provides methods to access the review's attributes.\n     *\n     * @return array An associative array containing the review's data.\n     */\n    public function getReviewData(): array {\n        return [\n            'product_id' => $this->productId,\n            'user_id' => $this->userId,\n            'rating' => $this->rating,\n            'comment' => $this->comment,\n            'review_date' => $this->reviewDate,\n        ];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Format Review for Display\n     *\n     * Formats the review data for display in a user-friendly format.\n     *\n     * @return string  A formatted string representing the review.\n     */\n    public function formatReview(): string {\n        return sprintf(\n            \"<b>Product ID:</b> %d<br>\n             <b>User ID:</b> %d<br>\n             <b>Rating:</b> %d stars<br>\n             <b>Comment:</b> %s<br>\n             <b>Review Date:</b> %s\",\n            $this->productId,\n            $this->userId,\n            $this->rating,\n            $this->comment,\n            $this->reviewDate\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\n\n// Create a new review\n$review = new UserReview(123, 456, 5, \"Excellent product!

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. They mentioned a function, so probably something that can be integrated into their existing codebase.\n\nFirst, I should outline the main features such a function would need. Reviews typically include a rating, title, comment, and some way to track who submitted it. So, I'll need parameters for these: user ID, product ID, rating, title, and comment.\n\nNext, I think about how this function will interact with the database. It needs to connect, insert data into a reviews table, handle any errors, and close the connection properly. Using mysqli is a good choice since it's more secure and efficient than the older mysql functions.\n\nI should also consider validation. The rating should be between 1 and 5, so I'll include checks for that. If the user enters an invalid rating, the function should return an error message instead of proceeding.\n\nSecurity is important too. I'll use prepared statements with placeholders to prevent SQL injection attacks. This ensures that any user input is handled safely.\n\nAfter setting up the database connection and preparing the query, executing it and checking for errors are crucial steps. If there's a failure in the insert, the function should return an appropriate error message.\n\nFinally, if everything goes well, the function will return a success message. I'll make sure to include examples of how to use this function so the user can see how it integrates into their code.\n\nI also need to remind them to replace placeholders like 'localhost', 'username', 'password', and 'reviews_db' with their actual database credentials. This way, they won't run into connection issues when testing the function.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that handles user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_title, $review_comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'username';\n    $password = 'password';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check for connection errors\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    // Validate input values\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating. Please enter a value between 1 and 5.\";\n    }\n\n    // Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n    $review_title = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $review_title);\n    $review_comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $review_comment);\n\n    // Prepare SQL statement\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, review_title, review_comment) \n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n\n    // Prepare and execute the query using prepared statements\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"sssss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_title, $review_comment);\n\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n\n    // Close database connection\n    mysqli_close($conn);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$review_title = \"Great Product!\";\n$review_comment = \"This is a fantastic product, very satisfied with my purchase.\";\n\n$result = submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_title, $review_comment);\necho $result;\n\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database\n2. Validates the input values\n3. Sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection\n4. Inserts a new review into the database\n5. Returns success or error messages\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Replace the database connection details (host, username, password, database) with your actual database credentials\n2. Ensure you have a table named `reviews` in your database with appropriate columns:\n   - user_id\n   - product_id\n   - rating\n   - review_title\n   - review_comment\n\nKey features of this function:\n\n- Input validation for the rating (must be between 1 and 5)\n- SQL injection prevention using mysqli_real_escape_string()\n- Error handling and informative error messages\n- Proper database connection closing after operation\n- Prepared statements for secure query execution\n\nMake sure to adjust the database schema and table/column names according to your actual database structure.\n\nYou can also modify this function to include additional fields or validation as needed for your specific use case.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_title, $review_comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'username';\n    $password = 'password';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check for connection errors\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    // Validate input values\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid rating.

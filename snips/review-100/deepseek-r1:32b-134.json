{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a review system entails. It usually involves users submitting reviews and ratings for a product or service. So, the main components would be a form for submission, storing that data in a database, displaying the reviews, calculating an average rating, and maybe handling some display logic like showing stars based on ratings.\n\nI'll start by outlining the steps. The first thing is to create a form where users can input their name, review text, and select a rating from 1 to 5. That makes sense because most review systems use a star rating system, which is intuitive for users.\n\nNext, I need to handle the form submission. In PHP, that means using POST method to send data to the server. So, when the form is submitted, the script should capture the input values. I should validate these inputs to prevent any malicious data from being inserted into the database. For example, checking that the name isn't empty, the review text isn't too short or too long, and the rating is an integer between 1 and 5.\n\nOnce validation is done, the next step is inserting this data into a MySQL database. I'll need to set up a connection using mysqli_connect because it's more secure than the older mysql functions. Then, prepare an SQL statement to insert the user_id (maybe from a logged-in session), name, review text, rating, and submission date into the reviews table.\n\nAfter inserting, redirecting the user back to the product page makes sense so they don't resubmit by refreshing. That's a common practice to avoid duplicate submissions.\n\nNow, displaying the reviews. I'll need to fetch all reviews from the database related to a specific product or service. Using mysqli_query and then fetching each row with mysqli_fetch_assoc will allow me to loop through each review and display it on the page. Each review should show the user's name, their rating as stars, the review text, and maybe the date it was submitted.\n\nCalculating the average rating is important for giving a quick overview of overall satisfaction. I can write an SQL query that averages the ratings column from the reviews table where product_id matches the current product. Then display this average, possibly rounded to one decimal place for clarity.\n\nSecurity is a big concern here. I need to make sure to sanitize inputs using mysqli_real_escape_string to prevent SQL injection attacks. Also, using prepared statements could add an extra layer of security, although in this example, I'll stick with basic escaping for simplicity.\n\nDisplaying stars can be done dynamically by looping through the rating value and printing star icons. If someone rated 4 out of 5, four filled stars and one empty. Using emojis like \u2b50 is a simple way without needing images or CSS frameworks.\n\nI should also consider how to handle different products. The review system should be tied to a specific product ID so that reviews are grouped correctly. This means the form submission and display functions need to know which product they're associated with, probably through a URL parameter or hidden input field.\n\nAnother thing is user sessions. Users should only submit one review per product. So, checking if the user has already submitted a review for that product before allowing them to submit another could be implemented, but maybe that's beyond the basic function.\n\nTesting each part as I go is important. For example, making sure that when a review is submitted, it appears on the page immediately without needing a server restart. Also, checking error handling\u2014what happens if someone submits an invalid rating or empty fields.\n\nI should also think about scalability. If this system grows, having proper database indexing and efficient queries will be important. But for now, assuming a basic setup where each product has its own set of reviews stored in the same table with a product_id foreign key.\n\nFinally, putting it all together: include the form at the bottom of the product page, after displaying existing reviews. When submitted, handle the input, store it, then redirect back so the new review is visible.\n\nI might have missed some edge cases, like handling different users or preventing multiple submissions from the same user. But for a basic function, covering submission, storage, validation, and display should suffice.\n</think>\n\nTo create a user review system using PHP, you'll need to:\n\n1. Create an HTML form for submitting reviews\n2. Add PHP code to handle form submission\n3. Store reviews in a database\n4. Display reviews on the product/service page\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$host = 'localhost';\n$user = 'root';\n$password = '';\n$dbname = 'reviews';\n\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Function to submit a review\nfunction submitReview($conn) {\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $name = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['name']);\n        $review_text = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['review-text']);\n        $rating = (int)$_POST['rating'];\n        \n        // Validate input\n        if ($name == '' || $review_text == '' || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            die('Please fill in all fields correctly!');\n        }\n        \n        // Insert into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, name, review_text, rating, submission_date)\n                VALUES ('\".$_SESSION['user_id'].\"', '\".$name.\"', '\".$review_text.\"', \".$rating.\", NOW())\";\n                \n        if (!mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            die('Error submitting review: ' . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n        \n        // Redirect to product page after submission\n        header(\"Location: \".$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);\n        exit();\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction displayReviews($conn) {\n    $id = $_GET['product_id']; // Assuming you're passing the product ID\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = \".$id;\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo '<div class=\"review\">';\n            echo '<h3>' . $row['name'] . '</h3>';\n            displayStars($row['rating']);\n            echo '<p>' . $row['review_text'] . '</p>';\n            echo '<small>Submitted on: ' . date('j F Y', strtotime($row['submission_date'])) . '</small>';\n            echo '</div>';\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo '<p>No reviews yet!</p>';\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display stars based on rating\nfunction displayStars($rating) {\n    $fullStars = (int)$rating;\n    $halfStar = ($rating - floor($rating)) >= 0.5 ? 1 : 0;\n    \n    for ($i=0; $i<5; $i++) {\n        if ($i < $fullStars) {\n            echo '\u2b50';\n        } elseif ($i == $fullStars && $halfStar) {\n            echo '\u2be8'; // Half star\n        } else {\n            echo '\u2606';\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating\nfunction getAverageRating($conn, $product_id) {\n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews WHERE product_id = \".$product_id;\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($conn);\n?>\n```\n\nTo use this system:\n\n1. Set up your database with a table named `reviews` containing:\n   - review_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)\n   - user_id (INT) - optionally link to users table\n   - product_id (INT)\n   - name (VARCHAR(255))\n   - review_text (TEXT)\n   - rating (TINYINT)\n   - submission_date (DATETIME)\n\n2. Include the functions in your PHP files\n\n3. Add this form to your product page:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"submit_review.php\" method=\"POST\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"product_id\" value=\"<?php echo $product_id; ?>\">\n    \n    <div class=\"form-group\">\n        <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"form-group\">\n        <label for=\"review-text\">Review:</label>\n        <textarea id=\"review-text\" name=\"review-text\" rows=\"5\" required></textarea>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"form-group\">\n        <label>Rating:</label>\n        <select name=\"rating\" required>\n            <option value=\"\">Select Rating</option>\n            <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n            <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n            <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n            <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n            <option value=\"5\">5 Stars</option>\n        </select>\n    </div>\n\n    <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn submit-btn\">Submit Review</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n4. Display reviews using:\n\n```php\n<?php displayReviews($conn); ?>\n```\n\nFeatures of this review system:\n\n1. Users can leave text reviews and ratings (1-5 stars)\n2. Reviews are stored in a database\n3. Displays average rating for the product\n4. Shows individual reviews with star ratings\n5. Includes basic input validation and sanitization\n\nSecurity notes:\n- Always use prepared statements or escape strings to prevent SQL injection\n- Store user sessions securely\n- Add CSRF protection if using this in production\n- Validate all inputs on both client and server side\n\nRemember to adapt the code to your specific database structure and security requirements.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$host = 'localhost';\n$user = 'root';\n$password = '';\n$dbname = 'reviews';\n\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Function to submit a review\nfunction submitReview($conn) {\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $name = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['name']);\n        $review_text = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['review-text']);\n        $rating = (int)$_POST['rating'];\n        \n        // Validate input\n        if ($name == '' || $review_text == '' || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            die('Please fill in all fields correctly!');\n        }\n        \n        // Insert into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, name, review_text, rating, submission_date)\n                VALUES ('\".$_SESSION['user_id'].\"', '\".$name.\"', '\".$review_text.\"', \".$rating.\", NOW())\";\n                \n        if (!mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            die('Error submitting review: ' . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n        \n        // Redirect to product page after submission\n        header(\"Location: \".$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);\n        exit();\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction displayReviews($conn) {\n    $id = $_GET['product_id']; // Assuming you're passing the product ID\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = \".$id;\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo '<div class=\"review\">';\n            echo '<h3>' . $row['name'] .

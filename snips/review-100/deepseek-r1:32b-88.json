{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and review text. That makes sense because each review is tied to a specific user and product.\n\nNext, I should connect to a database since we'll be storing the reviews there. I'll use mysqli for the connection because it's more secure than mysql_ functions. I'll need placeholders for the database credentials so the user can fill those in later.\n\nOnce connected, I'll prepare an SQL statement to insert the new review into the 'reviews' table. Using prepared statements will help prevent SQL injection attacks. I'll bind the parameters to the placeholders in the query to ensure data is handled safely.\n\nAfter executing the insert, I should check if it was successful. If not, return an error message. If it worked, maybe also update the product's average rating. To do that, I can calculate the new average by fetching the current sum of ratings and the count of reviews for that product. Then, compute the updated average and update the 'products' table accordingly.\n\nFinally, if everything goes well, return a success message. I'll make sure to close the database connections properly after each step to avoid any resource leaks.\n\nI should also mention in the note that the user needs to replace placeholders with actual values and ensure their database tables are set up correctly with the right columns.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for handling user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_text) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $db_host = \"localhost\";\n    $db_username = \"username\";\n    $db_password = \"password\";\n    $db_name = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_username, $db_password, $db_name);\n\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    // SQL statement to insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, review_text, review_date)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n\n    if ($stmt = $conn->prepare($sql)) {\n        // Bind parameters to the prepared statement\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_text);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            // Update product average rating\n            $update_avg_rating_sql = \"UPDATE products SET \n                                        avg_rating = (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?)\n                                      WHERE id = ?\";\n            \n            $update_stmt = $conn->prepare($update_avg_rating_sql);\n            $update_stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $product_id, $product_id);\n            $update_stmt->execute();\n            $update_stmt->close();\n\n            // Close statement and connection\n            $stmt->close();\n            $conn->close();\n\n            return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n        } else {\n            // Close statement and connection\n            $stmt->close();\n            $conn->close();\n            \n            return \"Error submitting review: \" . $stmt->error;\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Close connection\n        $conn->close();\n        \n        return \"Error preparing review submission: \" . $conn->error;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database using mysqli\n2. Prepares and executes an SQL statement to insert the user's review into the reviews table\n3. Updates the product's average rating in the products table after submitting the review\n4. Returns success or error messages\n\nKey features:\n- Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n- Handles database errors gracefully\n- Automatically updates the average rating for the reviewed product\n- Includes timestamps for reviews\n- Properly closes database connections and statements\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Replace the database connection details ($db_host, $db_username, etc.) with your actual database credentials\n2. Create a 'reviews' table in your database:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE reviews (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       user_id INT NOT NULL,\n       product_id INT NOT NULL,\n       rating INT NOT NULL,\n       review_text TEXT NOT NULL,\n       review_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n   ```\n3. Create a 'products' table with an avg_rating column:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE products (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       description TEXT,\n       avg_rating DECIMAL(2,1) DEFAULT 0\n   );\n   ```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```php\n// User-provided values\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 1;\n$rating = 5;\n$review_text = \"Great product! Highly recommended.\";\n\n$result = submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_text);\necho $result; // Outputs success or error message\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to:\n- Validate and sanitize user inputs before passing them to this function\n- Adjust the database schema according to your needs\n- Implement proper error handling for production environments\n- Secure your database connection with appropriate credentials", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_text) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $db_host = \"localhost\";\n    $db_username = \"username\";\n    $db_password = \"password\";\n    $db_name = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $conn = new mysqli($db_host, $db_username, $db_password, $db_name);\n\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    // SQL statement to insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, review_text, review_date)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n\n    if ($stmt = $conn->prepare($sql)) {\n        // Bind parameters to the prepared statement\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $review_text);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            // Update product average rating\n            $update_avg_rating_sql = \"UPDATE products SET \n                                        avg_rating = (SELECT AVG(rating) FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?)\n                                      WHERE id = ?\";\n            \n            $update_stmt = $conn->prepare($update_avg_rating_sql);\n            $update_stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $product_id, $product_id);\n            $update_stmt->execute();\n            $update_stmt->close();\n\n            // Close statement and connection\n            $stmt->close();\n            $conn->close();\n\n            return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n        } else {\n            // Close statement and connection\n            $stmt->close();\n            $conn->close();\n            \n            return \"Error submitting review: \" . $stmt->error;\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Close connection\n        $conn->close();\n        \n        return \"Error preparing review submission: \" . $conn->error;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", null]}

This is good object-oriented programming practice and allows you to reuse and extend the functionality later.\n\n* **Input Validation:**  Crucially, the `addReview()` method now includes *input validation*. This is *essential* for security and data integrity.  It checks if the reviewer's name and comment are empty.  If either is empty, it logs an error message using `error_log()` (which is better than `echo` for error handling \u2013 it logs to the server's error log) and returns `false`.  This prevents the insertion of invalid or malicious data.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Using `error_log()` is the correct way to handle errors in a web application.  It logs the error to the server's error log, which can be reviewed by a system administrator without directly displaying the error to the user (which could reveal sensitive information or cause a bad user experience).\n\n* **Timestamp:**  The `addReview()` method now includes a `date()` function to automatically record the date and time each review was submitted.  This is useful for tracking review trends over time.\n\n* **HTML Escaping:** The `displayReviews()` method uses `htmlspecialchars()` to escape the reviewer's name and comment before displaying them in the HTML.  This is *absolutely critical* to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Without it, a malicious user could inject JavaScript code into the reviews, which would then be executed by the user's browser.\n\n* **Clearer Display:** The HTML output is formatted with `<ul>` and `<li>` tags for a cleaner presentation.\n\n* **Example Usage:** The code includes a clear example of how to create an instance of the class, add reviews, and display the results.  It also demonstrates the error handling.\n\n* **Doc Comments:** The code includes detailed doc comments (using `/** ... */`) to explain the purpose of each function, its parameters, and its return value. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n\n* **Return Types:**  The `addReview()` function now has a return type declaration `(string $name, string $comment): bool` which specifies that it returns a boolean value.  This improves code readability and helps with static analysis.\n\nHow to use it:\n\n1.  **Save the Code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `reviews.php`).\n\n2.  **Place in Web Server Directory:**  Upload the file to your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs`, `www`, etc.).\n\n3.  **Access in Browser:** Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/reviews.php`).\n\nImportant Security Notes:\n\n*   **Never directly display user input in your web application without proper sanitization or escaping.**  The use of `htmlspecialchars()` is essential to prevent XSS attacks.\n*   **Consider using a more robust review system:** For production applications, it's highly recommended to use a dedicated review system or library. These systems typically provide more advanced features, such as:\n    *   Rating systems\n    *   Moderation features\n    *   Database integration\n    *   User authentication and authorization\n\nThis improved version provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a user review system. Remember to adapt the code to your specific needs and always prioritize security.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function\n *\n * This function allows you to collect and display user reviews for a given item or product.\n * It includes basic input validation and handles display of reviews.\n */\nclass UserReviewFunction\n{\n    private $reviews = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a new review to the collection.\n     *\n     * @param string $name The reviewer's name.\n     * @param string $comment The review comment.\n     * @return bool True if the review was added successfully, false otherwise (e.g., if input is invalid).\n     */\n    public function addReview(string $name, string $comment): bool\n    {\n        // Input Validation (Important for security and data integrity)\n        if (empty($name)) {\n            error_log(\"Invalid review: Missing reviewer name.\");\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (empty($comment)) {\n            error_log(\"Invalid review: Missing comment.\");\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        $this->reviews[] = [\n            'name' => $name,\n            'comment' => $comment,\n            'date' => date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\") // Add a timestamp for record keeping\n        ];\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all reviews.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of review objects.\n     */\n    public function getAllReviews(): array\n    {\n        return $this->reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Displays all reviews in a formatted way.\n     *\n     * @return void  Displays the reviews to the browser.\n     */\n    public function displayReviews(): void\n    {\n        echo \"<h2>User Reviews</h2>\";\n        if (empty($this->getAllReviews())) {\n            echo \"<p>No reviews yet.</p>\";\n        } else {\n            echo \"<ul>\";\n            foreach ($this->getAllReviews() as $review) {\n                echo \"<li><strong>\" . htmlspecialchars($review['name']) . \":</strong> \" . htmlspecialchars($review['comment']) . \"</li>\";\n            }\n            echo \"</ul>\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example Usage:\n// Create an instance of the UserReviewFunction class\n$reviewFunction = new UserReviewFunction();\n\n// Add some reviews\n$reviewFunction->addReview(\"Alice\", \"Great product!

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should outline what the function needs to do. It should allow users to submit reviews with a rating and comments. So, I'll need an HTML form where users can input their name, select a star rating, write comments, and submit it.\n\nNext, handling the form submission is crucial. When the user submits the form, the data needs to be processed. I'll use PHP to check if the form has been submitted and then retrieve the input values. It's important to sanitize these inputs to prevent SQL injection or other attacks. Maybe using htmlspecialchars for text fields and intval for numerical ratings would help.\n\nThen, storing the reviews in a database makes sense. I should set up a MySQL table to hold each review's details: id, user_id (if logged in), username, rating, comments, submission date, and status (active or inactive). This way, we can manage reviews easily and possibly moderate them later.\n\nDisplaying the reviews is another key part. I'll need a function that fetches all active reviews from the database. Sorting them by submission date would show the most recent ones first. For each review, display the username, rating as stars, comments, and date. Using emojis for stars can make it visually appealing without needing images.\n\nI should also think about user authentication. If only logged-in users can submit reviews, I'll need a check to see if a user is authenticated before allowing submission. This adds a layer of security and ensures that reviews come from legitimate users.\n\nModeration features are important too. Admins should be able to delete reviews or mark them inactive without removing the data entirely. Maybe adding a delete button in the admin panel would work, but I didn't include that in the initial example. It's something to consider for future enhancements.\n\nValidation is essential. All form fields must be checked to ensure they're not empty. If any are missing, display error messages to guide the user. This improves data integrity and user experience.\n\nDisplaying average ratings could be a nice touch. Calculating the average from all reviews gives users a quick overview of the overall sentiment. However, this wasn't part of the initial request but might be a good addition later.\n\nConsidering scalability, the function should handle multiple reviews efficiently. The current setup fetches all reviews, but in the future, pagination could help manage long lists without overwhelming the page.\n\nSecurity is paramount. Using prepared statements with PDO or mysqli can prevent SQL injection. Also, sanitizing inputs as mentioned before helps mitigate other vulnerabilities.\n\nTesting each part step by step is important. I'll start by creating the form, then handle submission and database insertion, followed by displaying reviews. Testing edge cases like empty fields, invalid ratings, and ensuring that only logged-in users can submit will help catch issues early.\n\nFinally, providing clear instructions on how to set up the function in a PHP file, include necessary files, and ensure database connections are properly handled is essential for someone else to use or modify this code.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function using PHP. This includes functions for submitting reviews, displaying reviews, and calculating average ratings:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"reviewdb\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Submit review function\nfunction submitReview($conn) {\n    if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n        // Sanitize input\n        $username = htmlspecialchars($_POST['username']);\n        $rating = intval($_POST['rating']);\n        $comments = htmlspecialchars($_POST['comments']);\n        \n        // Check if all fields are filled\n        if (empty($username) || empty($rating) || empty($comments)) {\n            echo \"Please fill in all fields.\";\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, rating, comments, submission_date)\n                VALUES ('$username', '$rating', '$comments', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n        \n        if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            echo \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n        } else {\n            echo \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Display reviews function\nfunction displayReviews($conn) {\n    // Get all reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY submission_date DESC\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>Reviewer: \" . $row['username'] . \"</h3>\";\n            echo \"<p>Rating: \" . str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $row['rating']) . str_repeat(\"\u2606\", 5 - $row['rating']) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>Comments: \" . $row['comments'] . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>Submitted on: \" . date('jS M Y, g:i a', strtotime($row['submission_date'])) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews found.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Calculate average rating function\nfunction averageRating($conn) {\n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n    \n    $average = round($row['average'], 1);\n    echo \"Average Rating: \" . str_repeat(\"\u2605\", floor($average)) . (($average - floor($average)) >= 0.5 ? \"\u00bd\" : \"\") . str_repeat(\"\u2606\", 5 - ceil($average));\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($conn);\n?>\n```\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Create a MySQL database and table named `reviews` with the following columns:\n   - id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n   - username (VARCHAR(255))\n   - rating (INT)\n   - comments (TEXT)\n   - submission_date (DATETIME)\n\n2. Replace the database connection details (`$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, `$dbname`) with your actual database credentials.\n\n3. Include this file in your PHP project and use the functions as needed:\n\n- To submit a review:\n```php\nsubmitReview($conn);\n```\n\n- To display reviews:\n```php\ndisplayReviews($conn);\n```\n\n- To show average rating:\n```php\naverageRating($conn);\n```\n\n4. Create an HTML form for submitting reviews:\n```html\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Your Name\">\n    <select name=\"rating\">\n        <option value=\"\">Rating</option>\n        <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n        <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"5\">5 Stars</option>\n    </select>\n    <textarea name=\"comments\" placeholder=\"Your Review\"></textarea>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit Review\">\n</form>\n```\n\nFeatures:\n- Reviews are stored in a database\n- Reviews display with username, rating (stars), comments, and submission date\n- Average rating is calculated and displayed\n- Input sanitization for security\n- Error handling\n\nNote: You may want to add additional features such as:\n- User authentication before submitting reviews\n- Review moderation/approval system\n- Pagination for displaying multiple reviews\n- Star rating validation\n- CSS styling for better display of ratings and reviews", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"reviewdb\";\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check connection\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Submit review function\nfunction submitReview($conn) {\n    if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n        // Sanitize input\n        $username = htmlspecialchars($_POST['username']);\n        $rating = intval($_POST['rating']);\n        $comments = htmlspecialchars($_POST['comments']);\n        \n        // Check if all fields are filled\n        if (empty($username) || empty($rating) || empty($comments)) {\n            echo \"Please fill in all fields.\";\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, rating, comments, submission_date)\n                VALUES ('$username', '$rating', '$comments', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n        \n        if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            echo \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n        } else {\n            echo \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Display reviews function\nfunction displayReviews($conn) {\n    // Get all reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY submission_date DESC\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>Reviewer: \" . $row['username'] . \"</h3>\";\n            echo \"<p>Rating: \" . str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $row['rating']) . str_repeat(\"\u2606\", 5 - $row['rating']) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>Comments: \" . $row['comments'] . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>Submitted on: \" . date('jS M Y, g:i a', strtotime($row['submission_date'])) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews found.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Calculate average rating function\nfunction averageRating($conn) {\n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n    \n    $average = round($row['average'], 1);\n    echo \"Average Rating: \" . str_repeat(\"\u2605\", floor($average)) .

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should outline the main features required. The function needs to allow users to leave reviews and ratings, store them in a database, display the reviews on a page, calculate the average rating, and handle any errors that might come up.\n\nOkay, so I'll start by setting up the database connection. That's essential because without connecting to the database, none of the functionality will work. I'll use mysqli for this since it's more secure than the older mysql functions.\n\nNext, I need an HTML form where users can input their reviews and ratings. The form should have fields for the user's name, email, review text, and a rating selection from 1 to 5 stars. I'll structure this using standard HTML elements and include some basic styling with CSS to make it look decent.\n\nNow, onto handling the form submission. When the user submits their review, the data needs to be processed in PHP. I'll check if the form has been submitted by looking for a POST request. Then, I'll validate each input field to ensure they're not empty and that the rating is within the acceptable range of 1 to 5.\n\nAfter validation, I should sanitize the inputs to prevent any SQL injection attacks. Using mysqli_real_escape_string will help with that. Once everything looks good, I'll insert the new review into the database using an INSERT query.\n\nBut what if there's an error during insertion? I should handle exceptions and display meaningful error messages so the user knows something went wrong.\n\nNow, displaying the reviews is another key part. I'll need a function that fetches all reviews from the database along with their average rating. Using a SELECT query, I can retrieve each review and its details. To calculate the average rating, I'll use the AVG() function in SQL and format it to two decimal places for clarity.\n\nOnce I have the reviews fetched, I'll loop through them and display each one on the page. For the ratings, I'll show stars corresponding to the given rating using CSS classes or inline styles. This makes the UI more intuitive.\n\nI also need a way to update the average rating whenever a new review is added. Alternatively, since the average can be calculated each time reviews are displayed, that might be more efficient than updating it after every submission.\n\nTesting is important. I should check if all form fields are correctly validated and sanitized. Also, ensuring that both successful submissions and errors are handled properly. Displaying the submitted review immediately without reloading the page would enhance user experience, but for simplicity, a reload might suffice in this initial version.\n\nFinally, putting it all together, I'll structure the PHP code with functions to handle submission and display. Including error handling and proper security measures will make the function robust. Styling the output with some CSS will make it visually appealing, even if it's just basic for now.\n\nIn summary, the steps are: connect to the database, create the review form, validate and sanitize inputs upon submission, insert into the database, fetch and display reviews, calculate the average rating, handle errors gracefully, and ensure everything is secure against SQL injection.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review system in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n$db_name = 'reviews_db';\n\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Function to create review form\nfunction createReviewForm() {\n    ?>\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n        <h2>Write a Review</h2>\n        <div class=\"form-group\">\n            <label for=\"name\">Name:</label><br>\n            <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required><br>\n            \n            <label for=\"email\">Email:</label><br>\n            <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required><br>\n            \n            <label for=\"review\">Review:</label><br>\n            <textarea id=\"review\" name=\"review\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"40\" required></textarea><br>\n            \n            <label for=\"rating\">Rating:</label><br>\n            <select id=\"rating\" name=\"rating\">\n                <option value=\"5\">5 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n            </select><br>\n            \n            <input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit_review\" value=\"Submit Review\">\n        </div>\n    </form>\n    <?php\n}\n\n// Function to handle review submission\nfunction submitReview($conn) {\n    if (isset($_POST['submit_review'])) {\n        $name = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['name']);\n        $email = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['email']);\n        $review = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['review']);\n        $rating = intval($_POST['rating']);\n\n        // Validate input\n        if (empty($name) || empty($email) || empty($review) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            echo \"Please fill in all required fields and select a valid rating.\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (name, email, review_text, rating) \n                VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$review', '$rating')\";\n        \n        if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            echo \"<div class='success'>Thank you for submitting your review!</div>\";\n        } else {\n            echo \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction displayReviews($conn) {\n    // Get all reviews\n    $sql = \"SELECT name, review_text, rating FROM reviews\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        echo \"<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>\";\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            $stars = str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $row['rating']);\n            echo \"\n                <div class='review'>\n                    <p><strong>{$row['name']}</strong></p>\n                    <p>$stars</p>\n                    <p>{$row['review_text']}</p>\n                </div>\n            \";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews yet.

A form for users to submit their reviews and ratings (1-5 stars)\n2. Input validation and sanitization\n3. Storage of reviews in a MySQL database\n4. Display of all submitted reviews with user names, ratings, and review text\n5. Calculation and display of average rating\n6. Error handling\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Create a MySQL database named `reviews_db`\n2. Create a table named `reviews` with the following columns:\n   - id (INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY)\n   - name (VARCHAR(255))\n   - email (VARCHAR(255))\n   - review_text (TEXT)\n   - rating (INT)\n\n3. Modify the database connection details at the top of the file to match your environment\n\nThe code includes basic error handling and input validation, but you might want to add more features such as:\n\n- User authentication\n- Review editing and deletion\n- Displaying reviews in a more user-friendly format\n- Adding timestamps for reviews\n- Implementing CAPTCHA or other anti-spam measures\n- Adding CSS styling for better presentation\n\nTo improve security:\n- Add prepared statements using mysqli\n- Implement CSRF protection\n- Use HTTPS\n- Add validation on both client and server sides\n- Store email addresses securely (e.g., hash them)\n\nYou can also enhance the user experience by adding features like:\n- Star rating visualization\n- Sorting reviews by date or rating\n- Pagination for a large number of reviews\n- User avatars or profile pictures\n- Like/dislike functionality for reviews\n\nRemember to always follow best security practices and validate all user input when working with databases.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n$db_name = 'reviews_db';\n\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Function to create review form\nfunction createReviewForm() {\n    ?>\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n        <h2>Write a Review</h2>\n        <div class=\"form-group\">\n            <label for=\"name\">Name:</label><br>\n            <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required><br>\n            \n            <label for=\"email\">Email:</label><br>\n            <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required><br>\n            \n            <label for=\"review\">Review:</label><br>\n            <textarea id=\"review\" name=\"review\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"40\" required></textarea><br>\n            \n            <label for=\"rating\">Rating:</label><br>\n            <select id=\"rating\" name=\"rating\">\n                <option value=\"5\">5 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n            </select><br>\n            \n            <input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit_review\" value=\"Submit Review\">\n        </div>\n    </form>\n    <?php\n}\n\n// Function to handle review submission\nfunction submitReview($conn) {\n    if (isset($_POST['submit_review'])) {\n        $name = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['name']);\n        $email = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['email']);\n        $review = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['review']);\n        $rating = intval($_POST['rating']);\n\n        // Validate input\n        if (empty($name) || empty($email) || empty($review) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            echo \"Please fill in all required fields and select a valid rating.\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (name, email, review_text, rating) \n                VALUES ('$name', '$email', '$review', '$rating')\";\n        \n        if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            echo \"<div class='success'>Thank you for submitting your review!</div>\";\n        } else {\n            echo \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction displayReviews($conn) {\n    // Get all reviews\n    $sql = \"SELECT name, review_text, rating FROM reviews\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        echo \"<h2>Customer Reviews</h2>\";\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            $stars = str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $row['rating']);\n            echo \"\n                <div class='review'>\n                    <p><strong>{$row['name']}</strong></p>\n                    <p>$stars</p>\n                    <p>{$row['review_text']}</p>\n                </div>\n            \";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews yet.

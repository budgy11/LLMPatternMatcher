This separation of concerns makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n* **Constructor:** The `Review` constructor now takes all the required parameters.\n* **Getters and Setters:** Includes public getter and setter methods for all the review properties. This allows for controlled access and potential validation logic in the future.\n* **`addReview()` Method:** The `ReviewManager`'s `addReview()` method creates a new `Review` object and adds it to the `$reviews` array.\n* **`getReviewsByProductId()` Method:**  Filters reviews by product ID.\n* **`getReviewsByUser()` Method:** Filters reviews by user ID.\n* **Date/Time:** Uses `date('Y-m-d H:i:s')` to generate a timestamp for the created_at property.\n* **Example Usage:**  Provides a clear example of how to use the code, creating reviews and retrieving them.\n* **Comments:**  Added extensive comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code.\n* **Error Handling (Considerations):**  This example lacks robust error handling. In a real-world application, you would need to add error handling for things like invalid input, database connection errors, etc.\n* **Validation (Considerations):** The code doesn't include input validation. You should add validation to ensure that data is in the correct format and within acceptable ranges (e.g., rating between 1 and 5).\n* **Database Integration (Considerations):**  This example stores reviews in memory. In a real-world application, you'd likely store reviews in a database.  You'd need to use a database library (e.g., PDO) to connect to the database and execute queries.\n\nThis revised answer provides a much more robust and well-structured foundation for a user review system in PHP.  It's now easier to extend and integrate with other parts of your application.  Remember to add the considerations mentioned above for a production-ready system.  This example is a starting point; adapt it to fit your specific requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function\n *\n * This function allows you to create, read, update, and delete user reviews.\n * It demonstrates basic CRUD operations and provides a simple interface\n * for managing reviews.\n *\n * Note: This is a simplified example for illustrative purposes.

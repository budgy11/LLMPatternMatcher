This class has methods to add new reviews and retrieve reviews for a specific product.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic example and does not include any error checking or validation, as well as database connections which should be handled in a real-world application. \n\nAlso, this code uses PHP's built-in `array_filter` function to filter the reviews for a specific product. In a more complex application, you might use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool or query your database directly.\n\nRemember to always validate user input and implement proper error handling in a production environment. \n\nIf you're looking for a more robust review system with features like voting, ranking, and comment threading, consider using a PHP framework that includes libraries and tools to help manage complex interactions between users and reviews.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Review model\nclass Review {\n    public $id;\n    public $product_id;\n    public $user_id;\n    public $rating;\n    public $review_text;\n\n    function __construct($id, $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $review_text) {\n        $this->id = $id;\n        $this->product_id = $product_id;\n        $this->user_id = $user_id;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->review_text = $review_text;\n    }\n}\n\n// Review controller\nclass ReviewController {\n    private $reviews;\n\n    function __construct() {\n        // Initialize reviews array (in a real application, this would likely come from a database)\n        $this->reviews = array();\n    }\n\n    function add_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $review_text) {\n        // Create new review object\n        $new_review = new Review(count($this->reviews) + 1, $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $review_text);\n\n        // Add review to reviews array\n        $this->reviews[] = $new_review;\n\n        return $new_review;\n    }\n\n    function get_reviews_for_product($product_id) {\n        // Filter reviews for the specified product\n        $product_reviews = array_filter($this->reviews, function ($review) use ($product_id) {\n            return $review->product_id == $product_id;\n        });\n\n        return $product_reviews;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$review_controller = new ReviewController();\n\n$new_review = $review_controller->add_review(123, 456, 5, \"Great product!\");\necho \"New review created: \\n\";\nprint_r($new_review);\n\n$product_reviews = $review_controller->get_reviews_for_product(123);\necho \"\\nReviews for product 123:\\n\";\nprint_r($product_reviews);\n\n?>\n```"]}

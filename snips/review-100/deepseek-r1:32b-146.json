{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and review text. Those are essential inputs. So I'll start by defining the function with these parameters.\n\nNext, I remember that database interactions are crucial here. The function should connect to a MySQL database. I'll need to use mysqli_connect for that, making sure to handle any connection errors properly.\n\nAfter connecting, I should check if a review already exists from the same user for the product. This is important to prevent duplicate reviews. I'll write a SELECT query to check this. If there's an existing review, maybe return a message about it.\n\nIf no existing review is found, the function should insert a new record into the reviews table. The INSERT statement will include the current timestamp for when the review was added. But wait, I should also handle any errors that might occur during the insertion, like if the query fails.\n\nOnce the review is successfully inserted, it's good practice to commit the transaction. This ensures data integrity and makes sure the changes are saved properly.\n\nFinally, after handling all database operations, the function should close the connection to free up resources. I'll include a mysqli_close statement for that.\n\nI also need to consider error handling throughout the process. Proper error messages will help in debugging if something goes wrong, especially when the connection fails or the query execution has issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will connect to the database, check for existing reviews, insert a new one if necessary, handle errors, and then close the connection. This should cover all the bases for a basic review submission system.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function to handle user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submitReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $reviewText) {\n    // Database configuration\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $dbUsername = \"username\";\n    $dbPassword = \"password\";\n    $dbName = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    try {\n        // Start transaction\n        mysqli_begin_transaction($conn);\n        \n        // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n        $checkReviewQuery = \"SELECT review_id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ? AND product_id = ?\";\n        $stmtCheck = mysqli_prepare($conn, $checkReviewQuery);\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmtCheck, \"ii\", $userId, $productId);\n        mysqli_stmt_execute($stmtCheck);\n        \n        // Get result\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmtCheck);\n        $existingReview = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n\n        if ($existingReview) {\n            // User already reviewed this product\n            return \"You have already reviewed this product.\";\n        } else {\n            // Insert new review\n            $insertReviewQuery = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, review_text, review_date)\n                                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n            \n            $stmtInsert = mysqli_prepare($conn, $insertReviewQuery);\n            mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmtInsert, \"iisi\", $userId, $productId, $rating, $reviewText);\n            \n            if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmtInsert)) {\n                // Commit the transaction\n                mysqli_commit($conn);\n                return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n            } else {\n                // Rollback on error\n                mysqli_rollback($conn);\n                return \"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n            }\n        }\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Rollback on exception\n        mysqli_rollback($conn);\n        return \"An error occurred while processing your review. Please try again later.\";\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes the following features:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database using mysqli extension\n2. Checks if the user has already submitted a review for the product\n3. If no existing review is found, inserts a new review into the database\n4. Handles errors and exceptions properly\n5. Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n6. Manages database transactions\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Replace the database configuration variables ($host, $dbUsername, etc.) with your actual database credentials\n2. Create a `reviews` table in your database with the following columns:\n   - review_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n   - user_id (INT)\n   - product_id (INT)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - review_text (TEXT)\n   - review_date (DATETIME)\n\nExample usage:\n\n```php\n$userId = 123;\n$productId = 456;\n$rating = 5;\n$reviewText = \"This is an excellent product!\";\n\n$result = submitReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $reviewText);\necho $result;\n```\n\nThe function returns a message indicating whether the review was successfully submitted or if there was an error.\n\nNote: Make sure to:\n1. Sanitize user input data\n2. Implement proper validation for ratings (e.g., ensure it's between 1 and 5)\n3. Add appropriate security measures like CSRF protection in a real-world application\n\nYou can modify the function according to your specific requirements, such as adding more fields or changing the database schema.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submitReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $reviewText) {\n    // Database configuration\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $dbUsername = \"username\";\n    $dbPassword = \"password\";\n    $dbName = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    try {\n        // Start transaction\n        mysqli_begin_transaction($conn);\n        \n        // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n        $checkReviewQuery = \"SELECT review_id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ?

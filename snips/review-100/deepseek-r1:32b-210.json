{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function in PHP. Let me think about what this function should do. The user wants to submit a review, so the function needs to handle form data like name, email, rating, and comment. Then it should store that data into a database.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the steps. The function will receive POST data from a form submission. I need to make sure all required fields are filled out\u2014name, email, rating, and comment can't be empty. Also, I should validate the email format because it's important for contact purposes.\n\nNext, I should sanitize the input to prevent SQL injection. Using htmlspecialchars or mysqli_real_escape_string would be good here. Maybe using prepared statements with mysqli would be even safer, but I'll stick with escaping for simplicity in this example.\n\nThen, I'll connect to the database. I'll need the host, username, password, and database name. Once connected, I'll prepare an INSERT statement to add the review into the reviews table. After executing the query, I should check if it was successful and handle any errors.\n\nIf everything goes well, maybe redirect the user back to a thank you page or show a success message. If not, display an error.\n\nI should also consider adding timestamps to track when each review was submitted. That could be useful for displaying reviews in order or filtering them later.\n\nWait, what about the HTML form? I need to make sure it has all the necessary fields with correct names so that the PHP function can access them correctly. Including a CSRF token might be good practice to prevent cross-site request forgery, but maybe that's beyond the scope here.\n\nI should also handle cases where the database connection fails. Maybe include error handling for that scenario as well.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code step by step: start with the form, then process the submission, validate inputs, sanitize them, connect to the DB, insert into the table, check for errors, and redirect or display messages accordingly.\n\nI think including a redirect after successful insertion is a good idea to prevent resubmission if the user refreshes the page. But I should also include error messages on the same page if something goes wrong.\n\nMaybe add some feedback like \"Review submitted successfully!\" or \"Error: Please try again.\" to inform the user of what happened.\n\nI'll make sure to use proper indentation and comments for readability, even though it's a single function. That way, anyone reading the code can understand each step clearly.\n\nAlso, considering security, I should avoid echoing user inputs directly without sanitization in case there are any script injections. But since this is part of the backend processing, maybe that's handled elsewhere when displaying reviews.\n\nOkay, time to put all these thoughts into code. Start with checking if the form was submitted using isset($_POST). Then validate each field, sanitize them, connect to the DB, insert, handle errors, and redirect or show messages.\n</think>\n\nHere is an example of a user review submission function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Review submission function\nfunction submitReview() {\n    // Check if form was submitted\n    if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {\n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $name = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['name']));\n        $email = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['email']));\n        $rating = intval($_POST['rating']);\n        $comment = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['comment']));\n\n        // Validate input data\n        if (empty($name) || empty($email) || empty($rating) || empty($comment)) {\n            die(\"Please fill in all required fields.\");\n        }\n\n        if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n            die(\"Invalid email format.\");\n        }\n\n        // Database connection parameters\n        $host = \"localhost\";\n        $db_username = \"root\";\n        $db_password = \"\";\n        $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n        // Connect to database\n        $connection = new mysqli($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n        // Check connection\n        if ($connection->connect_error) {\n            die(\"Connection failed: \" . $connection->connect_error);\n        }\n\n        // Prepare and bind the statement\n        $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (name, email, rating, comment, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\");\n        \n        if ($stmt === false) {\n            die(\"Prepare failed: \" . $connection->error);\n        }\n\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ssii\", $name, $email, $rating, $comment);\n\n        // Execute the statement\n        if (!$stmt->execute()) {\n            die(\"Execute failed: \" . $stmt->error);\n        }\n\n        // Close statements and connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $connection->close();\n\n        // Redirect after submission\n        header(\"Location: thank_you.php\");\n        exit;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes the following features:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Checks that all required fields are filled out.\n2. **Sanitization**: Uses `htmlspecialchars()` and `trim()` to clean user input.\n3. **Email Verification**: Validates email format using `filter_var()`.\n4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses prepared statements with parameter binding.\n5. **Database Connection Handling**:\n   - Connects to the database\n   - Handles connection errors\n6. **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid submissions or database errors.\n7. **Timestamp Logging**: Automatically records when the review was submitted.\n8. **Redirection**: Redirects users after successful submission.\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Create an HTML form with corresponding fields:\n```html\n<form action=\"submit_review.php\" method=\"post\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" required>\n    <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Your Email\" required>\n    <select name=\"rating\" required>\n        <option value=\"\">Rating</option>\n        <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n        <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"5\">5 Stars</option>\n    </select>\n    <textarea name=\"comment\" placeholder=\"Your Review\" required></textarea>\n    <button type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n2. Create a thank you page (`thank_you.php`) to display after successful submission.\n\n3. Create a MySQL database and table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    rating INT NOT NULL,\n    comment TEXT NOT NULL,\n    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n4. Place the `submit_review.php` file in your project and call the function when needed.\n\nRemember to adjust the database connection parameters (`$db_username`, `$db_password`, `$database`) according to your actual database setup.\n\n**Note:** This is a basic implementation. Depending on your needs, you might want to add additional features such as:\n\n- **CAPTCHA Verification**: To prevent spam submissions.\n- **User Authentication**: To allow only registered users to submit reviews.\n- **Moderation System**: To approve reviews before they are displayed publicly.\n- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent multiple submissions from the same user within a short period.\n- **Email Notification**: To notify admins when a new review is submitted.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Review submission function\nfunction submitReview() {\n    // Check if form was submitted\n    if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {\n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $name = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['name']));\n        $email = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['email']));\n        $rating = intval($_POST['rating']);\n        $comment = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['comment']));\n\n        // Validate input data\n        if (empty($name) || empty($email) || empty($rating) || empty($comment)) {\n            die(\"Please fill in all required fields.\");\n        }\n\n        if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n            die(\"Invalid email format.\");\n        }\n\n        // Database connection parameters\n        $host = \"localhost\";\n        $db_username = \"root\";\n        $db_password = \"\";\n        $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n        // Connect to database\n        $connection = new mysqli($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n        // Check connection\n        if ($connection->connect_error) {\n            die(\"Connection failed: \" . $connection->connect_error);\n        }\n\n        // Prepare and bind the statement\n        $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (name, email, rating, comment, timestamp) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\");\n        \n        if ($stmt === false) {\n            die(\"Prepare failed: \" . $connection->error);\n        }\n\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ssii\", $name, $email, $rating, $comment);\n\n        // Execute the statement\n        if (!$stmt->execute()) {\n            die(\"Execute failed: \" . $stmt->error);\n        }\n\n        // Close statements and connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $connection->close();\n\n        // Redirect after submission\n        header(\"Location: thank_you.php\");\n        exit;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", null, null]}

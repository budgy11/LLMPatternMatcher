{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, it needs to handle adding a new review. So, I'll probably have parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. Then, it should insert these into the database.\n\nWait, but before inserting, I should validate the inputs. The rating must be between 1 and 5. Also, comments shouldn't be too long\u2014maybe limit to 1000 characters.\n\nSecurity is important too. I'll use prepared statements with PDO to prevent SQL injection. That way, user inputs are sanitized.\n\nNext, after inserting the review, I should calculate the average rating for that product. This will help display the current rating on the front end. So, I'll write a query to get the average from the reviews table where product ID matches.\n\nI should also handle any errors that might occur during database operations. Maybe include try-catch blocks or check for errors after each query.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n1. Connect to the database using PDO.\n2. Check if the rating is valid and comment isn't too long.\n3. Insert the new review into the reviews table.\n4. Update the average rating in the products table.\n5. Return a success message or handle any errors.\n\nHmm, I should make sure that the function can be called from other parts of the application easily. Maybe include error handling so that if something goes wrong, it returns an appropriate message.\n\nAlso, I need to think about how often the average rating is updated. Since each review affects the average, updating it every time a new review is added makes sense for accuracy.\n\nI should test this function with different scenarios: valid inputs, invalid ratings, empty comments, and check if the database updates correctly.\n\nWait, what if there are no reviews yet? The average calculation might cause division by zero. So I'll need to handle that case, maybe setting the average to 0 or handling it in the query.\n\nI think using a stored procedure for updating the average could be efficient, but for simplicity, I'll do it within the PHP function for now.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will connect, validate, insert, update the average, and return success. If any step fails, it returns an error message.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction addReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Connect to database\n    try {\n        $conn = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=your_database', 'username', 'password');\n        $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n        \n        // Validate input\n        if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            return \"Invalid rating. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.\";\n        }\n        if (strlen($comment) > 1000) {\n            return \"Comment is too long. Maximum allowed length is 1000 characters.\";\n        }\n        \n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $userId = htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($userId));\n        $productId = htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($productId));\n        $rating = intval($rating);\n        $comment = htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($comment));\n        \n        // Insert review into database\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) \n                              VALUES (:userId, :productId, :rating, :comment)\");\n        $stmt->bindParam(':userId', $userId);\n        $stmt->bindParam(':productId', $productId);\n        $stmt->bindParam(':rating', $rating);\n        $stmt->bindParam(':comment', $comment);\n        \n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            // Calculate average rating for the product\n            $avgStmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT AVG(rating) as avg_rating FROM reviews WHERE product_id = :productId\");\n            $avgStmt->bindParam(':productId', $productId);\n            $avgStmt->execute();\n            \n            $avgResult = $avgStmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n            $averageRating = round($avgResult['avg_rating'], 1);\n            \n            // Update product table with new average rating\n            $updateAvgStmt = $conn->prepare(\"UPDATE products SET average_rating = :averageRating WHERE id = :productId\");\n            $updateAvgStmt->bindParam(':averageRating', $averageRating);\n            $updateAvgStmt->bindParam(':productId', $productId);\n            \n            if ($updateAvgStmt->execute()) {\n                return \"Review added successfully!\";\n            } else {\n                return \"Error updating average rating.\";\n            }\n        } else {\n            return \"Error adding review.\";\n        }\n        \n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        echo \"Connection failed: \" . $e->getMessage();\n        return \"Database error occurred.\";\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database using PDO\n2. Validates the input values:\n   - Ensures rating is numeric and between 1-5\n   - Limits comment length to 1000 characters\n3. Sanitizes the inputs to prevent SQL injection\n4. Inserts the review into the reviews table\n5. Calculates the new average rating for the product\n6. Updates the products table with the new average rating\n7. Returns success or error messages\n\nTo use this function:\n\n```php\n// Example usage:\n$reviewResult = addReview(1, 2, 4, \"Great product!\");\necho $reviewResult;\n```\n\nMake sure to:\n\n1. Replace the database connection details (host, dbname, username, password) with your actual database credentials\n2. Create the necessary tables in your database:\n   - reviews table with columns: id, user_id, product_id, rating, comment, created_at\n   - products table with columns: id, name, average_rating, etc.\n\nFeatures of this function:\n\n- Input validation\n- SQL injection prevention\n- Error handling\n- Automatic average rating calculation\n- Clean separation of concerns\n\nYou might want to add additional features like:\n\n1. Timestamp tracking for reviews\n2. User verification (ensuring users can't review the same product multiple times)\n3. Review editing/deletion capabilities\n4. More detailed error logging\n5. Support for different types of ratings (e.g., categories like quality, price, etc.)\n6. Integration with a rating display system\n\nRemember to adjust the database schema and connection details according to your specific needs.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see any additional features or modifications!", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction addReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Connect to database\n    try {\n        $conn = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=your_database', 'username', 'password');\n        $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n        \n        // Validate input\n        if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            return \"Invalid rating.

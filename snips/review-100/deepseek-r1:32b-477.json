{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a user review function entails. It should allow users to submit reviews, display them, and maybe handle things like validation and storage. So, I'll break it down into steps.\n\nStep one is setting up the database. I know that reviews typically have an ID, user ID, product ID, rating, comment, and timestamp. I should create a table for this in MySQL. Maybe name it 'reviews' with columns like review_id, user_id, product_id, rating, comment, and review_date.\n\nNext, I'll need a way to add reviews. So, an 'add_review' function that takes parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. This function should insert into the database. But wait, I should sanitize the inputs to prevent SQL injection. Using mysqli_real_escape_string would be good for that.\n\nAlso, validation is important. The rating should be between 1 and 5, so I'll include a check for that. If it's outside this range, throw an exception or return an error. Similarly, comments shouldn't be empty, so check the length.\n\nFor displaying reviews, another function like 'get_reviews' would fetch all reviews for a specific product. It should join with the users table to get user details. Ordering by date descending makes sense so newer reviews show first.\n\nI should also calculate the average rating for a product. Maybe create a helper function that queries the average rating from the reviews table where product ID matches.\n\nNow, about security and best practices. Using prepared statements would be better than escaping strings for preventing SQL injection. But since the example uses mysqli, I'll stick with escaping for now but note that prepared statements are more secure.\n\nHandling user sessions is another consideration. Users should only submit reviews if they're logged in, so check isset($_SESSION['user_id']) before allowing submission.\n\nDisplaying the reviews on a webpage would require fetching them via PHP and echoing them in HTML. Maybe using while loops to iterate over results and display each review with user info, rating stars, comment, and date.\n\nTesting is important too. I should test edge cases like invalid ratings, empty comments, and make sure all error handling works. Also, ensure that the average rating calculation is accurate.\n\nPutting it all together, the functions would handle adding reviews, fetching them, calculating averages, and displaying. But in a real application, there might be more considerations like pagination for many reviews, edit/delete options, reporting system, etc.\n\nI think I've covered the main points. Now, I'll outline the code structure, including database connection setup, the functions with proper error handling, validation, and examples of usage.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection parameters\n$host = 'localhost';\n$user = 'username';\n$password = 'password';\n$dbname = 'reviews_db';\n\n// Create database connection\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check if connection is successful\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    // Validate input\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5\");\n    }\n    \n    if (empty($comment)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Comment cannot be empty\");\n    }\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment)\n            VALUES ('$user_id', '$product_id', '$rating', '$comment')\";\n\n    if (!mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Error adding review: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n// Function to get reviews for a product\nfunction get_reviews($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    // Get reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT r.*, u.username \n            FROM reviews r \n            JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id \n            WHERE r.product_id = '$product_id' \n            ORDER BY r.review_date DESC\";\n\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n    if (!$result) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Error fetching reviews: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    return $result;\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating for a product\nfunction get_average_rating($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    // Calculate average rating\n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE product_id = '$product_id'\";\n\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n    if (!$result) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Error calculating average rating: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n    return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n\ntry {\n    // Add a review\n    add_review(1, 101, 4, \"Great product!\");\n\n    // Get reviews for product ID 101\n    $reviews = get_reviews(101);\n    \n    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($reviews)) {\n        echo \"User: \" . $row['username'] . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Rating: \" . $row['rating'] . \"/5<br>\";\n        echo \"Comment: \" . $row['comment'] . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Date: \" . $row['review_date'] . \"<br><br>\";\n    }\n\n    // Get average rating for product ID 101\n    $average_rating = get_average_rating(101);\n    echo \"Average Rating: \" . $average_rating . \"/5\";\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($conn);\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes:\n\n1. Database connection setup\n\n2. `add_review()` function:\n   - Adds a new review to the database\n   - Includes input validation and sanitization\n   - Throws exceptions for errors\n\n3. `get_reviews()` function:\n   - Retrieves reviews for a specific product\n   - Joins with user table to get user information\n   - Returns results ordered by date\n\n4. `get_average_rating()` function:\n   - Calculates the average rating for a product\n   - Rounds to one decimal place\n\n5. Example usage showing how to:\n   - Add a review\n   - Retrieve and display reviews\n   - Get and display average rating\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Update database connection parameters (`$host`, `$user`, etc.)\n\n2. Create the necessary database tables (users, products, reviews)\n\n3. Make sure your users are authenticated before allowing them to submit reviews\n\n4. Add proper error handling and validation in your application\n\n5. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries for better security\n\n6. Add pagination if you have a large number of reviews\n\n7. Add CSS styling to display ratings as stars or other visual elements\n\nRemember to:\n- Sanitize all user inputs\n- Validate data before storing it\n- Handle errors properly\n- Secure your database connection and queries\n- Implement proper session management for users\n- Add CSRF protection for form submissions\n\nThis is a basic example that you can customize according to your needs. You might want to add features like:\n- Review editing/deletion\n- Reporting system for inappropriate reviews\n- Sorting options (newest, highest rated, etc.)\n- Pagination for long lists of reviews\n- Loading more reviews dynamically with AJAX", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection parameters\n$host = 'localhost';\n$user = 'username';\n$password = 'password';\n$dbname = 'reviews_db';\n\n// Create database connection\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $password, $dbname);\n\n// Check if connection is successful\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    // Validate input\n    if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5\");\n    }\n    \n    if (empty($comment)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Comment cannot be empty\");\n    }\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment)\n            VALUES ('$user_id', '$product_id', '$rating', '$comment')\";\n\n    if (!mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Error adding review: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n// Function to get reviews for a product\nfunction get_reviews($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    // Get reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT r.*, u.username \n            FROM reviews r \n            JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id \n            WHERE r.product_id = '$product_id' \n            ORDER BY r.review_date DESC\";\n\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n    if (!$result) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Error fetching reviews: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    return $result;\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating for a product\nfunction get_average_rating($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    // Calculate average rating\n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE product_id = '$product_id'\";\n\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n\n    if (!$result) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Error calculating average rating: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n    return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n\ntry {\n    // Add a review\n    add_review(1, 101, 4, \"Great product!\");\n\n    // Get reviews for product ID 101\n    $reviews = get_reviews(101);\n    \n    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($reviews)) {\n        echo \"User: \" . $row['username'] . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Rating: \" . $row['rating'] . \"/5<br>\";\n        echo \"Comment: \" . $row['comment'] . \"<br>\";\n        echo \"Date: \" . $row['review_date'] . \"<br><br>\";\n    }\n\n    // Get average rating for product ID 101\n    $average_rating = get_average_rating(101);\n    echo \"Average Rating: \" . $average_rating . \"/5\";\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($conn);\n?>\n```"]}

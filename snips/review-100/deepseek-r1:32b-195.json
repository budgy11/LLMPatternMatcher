{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user asked me to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. Probably, they want a function that allows users to leave reviews and maybe also display those reviews on a webpage.\n\nFirst, I should consider how reviews are typically handled. Usually, you need to store them somewhere, so a database makes sense. I'll use MySQL since it's common. The function will probably handle both submitting new reviews and fetching existing ones to display.\n\nI should start by setting up the database connection. That means using mysqli_connect with the host, username, password, and database name. Then, for adding a review, I need a function that takes parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. I'll have to sanitize these inputs to prevent SQL injection, maybe using mysqli_real_escape_string.\n\nNext, the add_review function should insert the new data into the reviews table. I'll write an SQL INSERT query for that. After executing it, I should check if it was successful and return a boolean indicating success or failure.\n\nFor displaying the reviews, another function is needed. It will fetch all reviews for a specific product. So, I'll write a SELECT query joining the users and reviews tables to get user details along with the review info. Using mysqli_fetch_assoc will let me loop through each result and build an array of reviews to return.\n\nI also need to handle cases where there are no reviews yet. The function should still work without errors in that case. Additionally, displaying star ratings would enhance the user experience, so I'll include code snippets for that using CSS classes based on the rating.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll outline how to use these functions in a PHP script, including connecting to the database and calling add_review and get_reviews functions. Error handling is important too, so I'll include checks after executing queries to display messages if something goes wrong.\n\nFinally, I should consider any potential improvements or additional features like allowing edits or deletions, implementing validation beyond sanitization, pagination for many reviews, sorting options, and a frontend form for submitting reviews. These can be mentioned as optional enhancements depending on the user's needs.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP that allows users to submit reviews and display them:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection details\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n$db_name = 'reviews_db';\n\n// Connect to database\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n    \n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) \n            VALUES ('$user_id', '$product_id', '$rating', '$comment')\";\n            \n    if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to get reviews for a specific product\nfunction get_reviews($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    \n    // Get reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT r.*, u.username \n            FROM reviews r \n            JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id \n            WHERE r.product_id = '$product_id'\n            ORDER BY r.review_date DESC\";\n            \n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if ($result) {\n        $reviews = array();\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            $reviews[] = $row;\n        }\n        return $reviews;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nif (isset($_POST['submit_review'])) {\n    // Assuming the form has fields: rating, comment\n    $user_id = $_SESSION['user_id']; // Ensure user is logged in\n    $product_id = 1; // Specific product ID\n    $rating = $_POST['rating'];\n    $comment = $_POST['comment'];\n    \n    if (add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n        echo \"Thank you for your review!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error submitting your review. Please try again.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Display reviews for product ID 1\n$reviews = get_reviews(1);\nif ($reviews) {\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        // Display each review\n        echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n        echo \"<h3>Rating: \" . str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $review['rating']) . \"</h3>\";\n        echo \"<p>\" . $review['comment'] . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<small>Posted by: \" . $review['username'] . \"</small>\";\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"No reviews yet.\";\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($conn);\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes:\n\n1. A database connection setup\n2. Two main functions:\n   - `add_review()`: Handles submitting new reviews to the database\n   - `get_reviews()`: Retrieves reviews for a specific product\n3. Example usage for both submitting and displaying reviews\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Make sure your database is set up with tables for users, products, and reviews\n2. Users must be logged in to submit reviews\n3. You'll need to create a form for submitting reviews\n4. Add appropriate error handling and validation as needed\n\nKey features:\n- Sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection\n- Joins user table to display username with each review\n- Displays ratings using stars\n- Orders reviews by date\n- Handles cases where no reviews exist\n\nYou may want to add additional functionality such as:\n- Review editing/deletion\n- More comprehensive validation\n- Pagination for large numbers of reviews\n- Sorting options (newest, highest rated, etc.)\n- Frontend review submission form\n- CSS styling for the reviews display\n\nRemember to replace the database connection details with your actual database information and adjust table/field names as needed.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection details\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n$db_name = 'reviews_db';\n\n// Connect to database\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n    \n    // Insert review into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) \n            VALUES ('$user_id', '$product_id', '$rating', '$comment')\";\n            \n    if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to get reviews for a specific product\nfunction get_reviews($product_id) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    \n    // Get reviews from database\n    $sql = \"SELECT r.*, u.username \n            FROM reviews r \n            JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id \n            WHERE r.product_id = '$product_id'\n            ORDER BY r.review_date DESC\";\n            \n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if ($result) {\n        $reviews = array();\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            $reviews[] = $row;\n        }\n        return $reviews;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nif (isset($_POST['submit_review'])) {\n    // Assuming the form has fields: rating, comment\n    $user_id = $_SESSION['user_id']; // Ensure user is logged in\n    $product_id = 1; // Specific product ID\n    $rating = $_POST['rating'];\n    $comment = $_POST['comment'];\n    \n    if (add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n        echo \"Thank you for your review!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error submitting your review.

This is *crucial* for better organization and maintainability.  This makes it easy to add more methods later (e.g., validating data, calculating average ratings, etc.).\n* **Unique Review ID:**  The `uniqid()` function generates a unique identifier for each review.  This is *essential* if you're going to be storing these reviews in a database (or any system where you need to identify them).  Using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) would be even better for scale.\n* **Date/Time:** Includes a timestamp (`date('Y-m-d H:i:s')`) to record when the review was submitted.  This is very important for sorting reviews by date and for analytics.\n* **Getters:**  Provides getter methods (`getProductId()`, `getUserId()`, etc.) to access the review attributes.  This is good practice, especially if you might want to change the internal storage format later.  Using getters allows you to control how the attributes are accessed and potentially add validation or other logic.\n* **`displayReview()` Method:** Provides a formatted output of the review, making it easy to display to the user or log to a file.\n* **`processReview()` Function:**  This function demonstrates how you'd handle a received review.  It calls the `displayReview()` method to show the review and includes a placeholder comment about saving the review to a database.\n* **Error Handling (Placeholder):** In a production application, you would add error handling and validation within the `processReview()` function to ensure the review data is valid before saving it. This code provides a good starting point.\n* **Clearer Comments & Docblocks:**  The code is thoroughly commented and includes docblocks to explain the purpose of each function and class.\n* **Example Usage:** Shows how to create instances of the `Review` class and how to call the `processReview()` function.\n* **PHP Version Compatibility:** The code uses modern PHP features (type hinting) but will still run on PHP 7.4 or higher.  If you need compatibility with older versions, you may need to adjust the code (e.g., remove type hinting).\n\nHow to Use:\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `reviews.php`).\n2.  **Run it:**  Run the file from your command line using `php reviews.php`.  You'll see the formatted reviews printed to the console.\n3.  **Integration:** Adapt this code to integrate with your application.  You'll need to:\n    *   Modify the `processReview()` function to save the review data to your database or other storage system.\n    *   Add validation to ensure the data is valid before saving.\n    *   Implement user authentication (to associate reviews with users).\n\nThis improved version provides a solid foundation for building a more complete user review system.  It's well-structured, documented, and ready to be extended.  Remember that a production-ready review system would require additional features like user authentication, rating validation, and database integration.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Reviews class to handle user reviews for a product or service.\n */\nclass Review {\n\n    private $productId;\n    private $userId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date;\n    private $reviewId;  // Unique identifier for the review.\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     * \n     * @param int $productId The ID of the product or service being reviewed.\n     * @param int $userId The ID of the user submitting the review.\n     * @param int $rating The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The user's comment/feedback.\n     */\n    public function __construct(int $productId, int $userId, int $rating, string $comment) {\n        $this->productId = $productId;\n        $this->userId = $userId;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->date = date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); // Timestamp of the review.\n        $this->reviewId = uniqid(); // Generate a unique ID for the review.\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Getters for each review attribute.\n     * \n     * @return mixed\n     */\n    public function getProductId() {\n        return $this->productId;\n    }\n\n    public function getUserId() {\n        return $this->userId;\n    }\n\n    public function getRating() {\n        return $this->rating;\n    }\n\n    public function getComment() {\n        return $this->comment;\n    }\n\n    public function getDate() {\n        return $this->date;\n    }\n\n    public function getReviewId() {\n        return $this->reviewId;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *  Display the review in a user-friendly format.\n     *\n     * @return string\n     */\n    public function displayReview() {\n        return \"Review ID: \" . $this->reviewId . \"\\n\" .\n               \"Product ID: \" . $this->productId . \"\\n\" .\n               \"User ID: \" . $this->userId . \"\\n\" .\n               \"Rating: \" . $this->rating . \"\\n\" .\n               \"Comment: \" . $this->comment . \"\\n\" .\n               \"Date: \" . $this->date;\n    }\n}\n\n/**\n * Function to process user reviews (example usage)\n */\nfunction processReview(Review $review) {\n    echo \"New Review Received:\\n\";\n    echo $review->displayReview() . \"\\n\";\n\n    // In a real application, you'd likely save this review to a database.\n    //  This is a placeholder for that functionality.\n    echo \"Review processed (placeholder - saving to database would happen here).\\n\";\n}\n\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\n\n// Create some reviews\n$review1 = new Review(123, 45, 5, \"Excellent product!

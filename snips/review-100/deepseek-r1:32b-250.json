{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, it needs to add a new review to the database. So, I'll start by writing an INSERT statement that includes the product ID, user ID, rating, and comment. I should make sure to use prepared statements with placeholders to prevent SQL injection attacks. That means using mysqli_stmt_bind_param to bind the variables securely.\n\nNext, after adding the review, the function should update the average rating for that product. To do this, I'll calculate the total of all ratings for the product and then divide by the number of reviews. This way, the average stays accurate as new reviews come in. Again, using prepared statements here is important for security.\n\nI also need to handle errors properly. If either the insertion or the update fails, the function should return false. I'll check each step with if statements and use mysqli_error to log any issues.\n\nOh, right, I should remind the user to replace placeholders like 'your_database_name' and 'password' with their actual database credentials. Also, they need to make sure the database tables exist and have the correct columns.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will connect to the database, insert the review, update the average rating, handle any errors, and then close the connection. That should cover the main requirements.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that handles user reviews for a product or service:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction add_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_name = 'your_database_name';\n    $username = 'root';\n    $password = 'password';\n\n    try {\n        // Create database connection\n        $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n\n        // Check connection\n        if ($conn->connect_error) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at)\n                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n        \n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n        if (!$stmt) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n\n        // Bind parameters\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"iiis\", $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n        if (!$stmt->execute()) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . $stmt->error);\n        }\n\n        // Update product average rating\n        $sql_avg = \"UPDATE products SET \n                        total_ratings = (total_ratings + ?),\n                        average_rating = (average_rating * total_reviews + ?) / (total_reviews + 1),\n                        total_reviews = total_reviews + 1\n                    WHERE id = ?\";\n        \n        $stmt_avg = $conn->prepare($sql_avg);\n        if (!$stmt_avg) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n\n        // Bind parameters for average update\n        $stmt_avg->bind_param(\"iii\", $rating, $rating, $product_id);\n\n        if (!$stmt_avg->execute()) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . $stmt_avg->error);\n        }\n\n        // Close statements and connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $stmt_avg->close();\n        $conn->close();\n\n        return true;\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Handle errors\n        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Creates a database connection\n2. Inserts a new review into the `reviews` table with:\n   - Product ID\n   - User ID\n   - Rating (1-5)\n   - Comment\n   - Timestamp\n\n3. Updates the corresponding product's average rating in the `products` table\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n```php\n// Example usage\n$product_id = 123;\n$user_id = 456;\n$rating = 5;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n\nif (add_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n    echo \"Review added successfully!\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error adding review.\";\n}\n```\n\nRequired database structure:\n\n1. `reviews` table:\n   - id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n   - product_id (INT)\n   - user_id (INT)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - comment (TEXT)\n   - created_at (DATETIME)\n\n2. `products` table:\n   - id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n   - name (VARCHAR)\n   - average_rating (FLOAT)\n   - total_reviews (INT)\n   - total_ratings (INT)\n\nMake sure to:\n\n1. Replace the database connection details with your actual database information\n2. Create the necessary tables and columns in your database\n3. Handle user authentication and authorization before allowing users to submit reviews\n4. Sanitize and validate input data\n5. Add appropriate error handling for production use\n\nFeatures of this function:\n\n- Prevents SQL injection by using prepared statements\n- Automatically updates product average rating\n- Records the timestamp of each review\n- Returns success/failure status\n- Includes basic error handling\n\nYou might want to add additional features like:\n\n1. Review validation (e.g., check that rating is between 1-5)\n2. Comment length restrictions\n3. Duplicate review prevention\n4. Review moderation system\n5. Sorting and filtering reviews\n6. Pagination for displaying multiple reviews\n\nRemember to adjust the database schema and queries according to your specific requirements.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction add_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_name = 'your_database_name';\n    $username = 'root';\n    $password = 'password';\n\n    try {\n        // Create database connection\n        $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n\n        // Check connection\n        if ($conn->connect_error) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at)\n                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n        \n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n        if (!$stmt) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n\n        // Bind parameters\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"iiis\", $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n        if (!$stmt->execute()) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . $stmt->error);\n        }\n\n        // Update product average rating\n        $sql_avg = \"UPDATE products SET \n                        total_ratings = (total_ratings + ?),\n                        average_rating = (average_rating * total_reviews + ?) / (total_reviews + 1),\n                        total_reviews = total_reviews + 1\n                    WHERE id = ?\";\n        \n        $stmt_avg = $conn->prepare($sql_avg);\n        if (!$stmt_avg) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n\n        // Bind parameters for average update\n        $stmt_avg->bind_param(\"iii\", $rating, $rating, $product_id);\n\n        if (!$stmt_avg->execute()) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . $stmt_avg->error);\n        }\n\n        // Close statements and connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $stmt_avg->close();\n        $conn->close();\n\n        return true;\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Handle errors\n        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n// Example usage\n$product_id = 123;\n$user_id = 456;\n$rating = 5;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n\nif (add_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n    echo \"Review added successfully!\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error adding review.\";\n}\n```"]}

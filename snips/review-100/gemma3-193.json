This promotes reusability and makes it easier to manage the reviews.\n* **`addReview()` Method:** This method adds a new review to the `$reviews` array.  It includes basic validation to ensure that the username and comment are not empty.\n* **`getAllReviews()` Method:** This method returns all reviews as an array of review objects. This is the standard way to return a collection of data in PHP.  Returns an empty array if no reviews exist.\n* **`getReviewByUsername()` Method:**  Efficiently retrieves a review by its username. It iterates through the `$reviews` array and compares usernames.  Returns `null` if the review is not found.\n* **`deleteReview()` Method:** Removes a specific review by username. It iterates through the `$reviews` array, finds the review based on the username, and removes it using `unset()`.\n* **Error Handling/Validation:** Includes basic input validation in `addReview()`.  You can expand this to include more robust validation (e.g., checking comment length, validating input formats, etc.).\n* **Return Types:**  Uses return types (`: bool`, `: ?array`) to improve code clarity and type safety. The `?array` return type indicates that the method can return either an array or `null`.\n* **Example Usage:**  The code includes a comprehensive example of how to use the `UserReview` class, demonstrating how to add, retrieve, and delete reviews. This makes it easy to understand how the class is intended to be used.\n* **Clear Comments and Documentation:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each method and the overall functionality.  The class has a docblock-style comment for full documentation.\n* **Uses Standard PHP Practices:** The code uses common PHP conventions (e.g., naming conventions, array handling).\n* **Efficiency:** The `getReviewByUsername` function uses a `foreach` loop which is the most efficient way to iterate through an array in PHP for this purpose.  (Using `array_filter` would be another option but generally less efficient for smaller collections).\n\nHow to Use the Code:\n\n1. **Save the Code:** Save the code as a PHP file (e.g., `user_review.php`).\n2. **Run it in a Web Server:**  Place the file in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache).\n3. **Access in a Browser:** Open the file in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/user_review.php`).  You'll see the output of the example usage.\n4. **Integrate into Your Application:** Adapt the code to fit your specific application requirements.  You would likely integrate this class into your application's database interaction code to persist reviews to a database.\n\nThis improved version provides a robust, well-documented, and easy-to-use class for managing user reviews in your PHP applications.  It also demonstrates best practices for PHP code organization and documentation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n *\n * This class provides a simple way to manage user reviews for a product.\n * It allows adding reviews, retrieving all reviews, and retrieving individual reviews.\n */\nclass UserReview\n{\n    private $reviews = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a new user review.\n     *\n     * @param string $username The name of the user submitting the review.\n     * @param string $comment The user's review comment.\n     * @return bool True if the review was added successfully, false otherwise.\n     */\n    public function addReview(string $username, string $comment): bool\n    {\n        // Basic validation - you can expand this with more robust validation\n        if (empty($username) || empty($comment)) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        $this->reviews[] = ['username' => $username, 'comment' => $comment];\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all user reviews.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of review objects.

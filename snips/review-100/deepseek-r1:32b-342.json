{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like review text, rating, user ID, and product ID. These are essential to store the review properly.\n\nNext, I should connect to the database. Using mysqli is good because it's widely used and secure. I'll need to include the database connection details like host, username, password, and database name.\n\nAfter connecting, I should prepare an SQL query to insert the review into the database. It's important to use placeholders for security against SQL injection. The table structure should have columns for each parameter plus a timestamp for when the review was submitted.\n\nI'll check if the connection is successful. If not, display an error message. Then, prepare the statement and bind the parameters with their types to prevent any issues.\n\nExecuting the query will return whether it was successful or not. I'll handle errors by displaying messages if something goes wrong during execution.\n\nFinally, if everything works, the function should return true. This way, the caller knows the review was successfully added.\n\nI should also consider adding comments for clarity and make sure to close the database connection properly after use. Testing the function with sample data would be a good idea to ensure it's working as expected.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to add user review\nfunction add_review($review_text, $rating, $user_id, $product_id) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'root';\n    $password = '';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Prepare SQL query to insert review\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (review_text, rating, user_id, product_id, review_date)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n\n    // Prepare statement\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n\n    // Check if statement was prepared successfully\n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        echo \"Error preparing SQL statement: \" . $conn->error;\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Bind parameters to the statement\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"sisii\", $review_text, $rating, $user_id, $product_id);\n\n    // Execute the query\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        echo \"Review added successfully!\";\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error adding review: \" . $stmt->error;\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Close database connection\n    $conn->close();\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$review_text = \"Great product, highly recommended!\";\n$rating = 5;\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 1;\n\nadd_review($review_text, $rating, $user_id, $product_id);\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Creates a database connection\n2. Prepares an SQL query to insert a new review\n3. Binds the parameters to prevent SQL injection\n4. Executes the query and returns success or failure\n5. Includes error handling\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Make sure you have a MySQL database set up with a table named `reviews`\n2. The reviews table should have columns:\n   - review_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)\n   - review_text (TEXT)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - user_id (INT)\n   - product_id (INT)\n   - review_date (DATETIME)\n\n3. Update the database connection details (host, username, password, database) to match your environment\n\nYou can modify this function to include additional features such as:\n- Validation of input parameters\n- Sanitization of input data\n- Error logging\n- Support for different types of reviews\n- Association with multiple products/users\n- Timestamp management\n\nRemember to always sanitize and validate user inputs before inserting them into your database to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Function to add user review\nfunction add_review($review_text, $rating, $user_id, $product_id) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'root';\n    $password = '';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Prepare SQL query to insert review\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (review_text, rating, user_id, product_id, review_date)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n\n    // Prepare statement\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n\n    // Check if statement was prepared successfully\n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        echo \"Error preparing SQL statement: \" . $conn->error;\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Bind parameters to the statement\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"sisii\", $review_text, $rating, $user_id, $product_id);\n\n    // Execute the query\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        echo \"Review added successfully!\";\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error adding review: \" . $stmt->error;\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Close database connection\n    $conn->close();\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$review_text = \"Great product, highly recommended!\";\n$rating = 5;\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 1;\n\nadd_review($review_text, $rating, $user_id, $product_id);\n?>\n```"]}

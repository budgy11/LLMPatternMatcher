{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should probably take some parameters like the product ID and the user's rating. Oh, and maybe their name and comment too. So I'll define a function that accepts these as arguments: $productId, $rating, $username, and $comment.\n\nNext, I need to store these reviews in a database. That means I should connect to a MySQL database using mysqli_connect. I'll set up the connection details\u2014host, username, password, and database name.\n\nOnce connected, I should make sure the connection is successful. If there's an error, I'll throw an exception so it can be handled later.\n\nNow, checking if the user has already reviewed this product is important to prevent multiple reviews. I'll write a SELECT query to check for existing entries where product_id matches and username matches. If a row exists, return false because they've already reviewed.\n\nIf not, proceed to insert the new review into the database. The INSERT INTO statement will include the product_id, rating, username, comment, and the current timestamp using NOW().\n\nI should also handle any potential SQL injection by using prepared statements with placeholders for the parameters. This makes the function more secure.\n\nAfter inserting, I'll return true to indicate success. \n\nAdditionally, it's a good idea to have error handling around the database operations. If something goes wrong during execution, an exception will be thrown, which can be caught outside the function.\n\nFinally, maybe include some examples of how to use this function, showing parameter validation and try-catch blocks for better understanding.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($productId, $rating, $username, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $dbUsername = 'root';\n    $dbPassword = '';\n    $dbName = 'reviews_db';\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to database\n        $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n        \n        if (!$conn) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Could not connect to the database\");\n        }\n\n        // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n        $checkQuery = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ? AND username = ?\";\n        $stmtCheck = mysqli_prepare($conn, $checkQuery);\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmtCheck, \"is\", $productId, $username);\n        mysqli_stmt_execute($stmtCheck);\n        $resultCheck = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmtCheck);\n\n        if (mysqli_num_rows($resultCheck) > 0) {\n            // User already reviewed this product\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        // Insert new review into the database\n        $insertQuery = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, rating, username, comment, review_date) \n                       VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n        \n        $stmtInsert = mysqli_prepare($conn, $insertQuery);\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmtInsert, \"isss\", $productId, $rating, $username, $comment);\n\n        if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmtInsert)) {\n            // Review submitted successfully\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            // Error submitting review\n            throw new Exception(\"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n        return false;\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        if ($conn) {\n            mysqli_close($conn);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$product_id = 123; // Replace with actual product ID\n$rating = 5; // Rating between 1-5\n$username = \"john_doe\";\n$comment = \"This is a great product!\";\n\ntry {\n    if (submit_review($product_id, $rating, $username, $comment)) {\n        echo \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"You have already reviewed this product.\";\n    }\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database\n2. Checks if the user has already reviewed the product\n3. If not, inserts a new review into the database table\n4. Returns true/false based on success/failure\n\nKey features:\n\n- Prevents multiple reviews from the same user for the same product\n- Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n- Includes error handling\n- Stores timestamp of when the review was submitted\n- Handles database connection in a try-catch block\n\nTo use this function, you need to:\n\n1. Set up your database connection details (host, username, password, database name)\n2. Create a `reviews` table with appropriate columns:\n   - product_id (integer)\n   - rating (integer or float)\n   - username (string)\n   - comment (text)\n   - review_date (datetime)\n\nThe function returns:\n- True if the review was successfully submitted\n- False if the user has already reviewed this product\n- Throws an exception on errors\n\nMake sure to validate and sanitize inputs in your application before passing them to this function.\n\nYou can modify this function according to your specific needs, such as adding more fields or changing the database structure.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($productId, $rating, $username, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $dbUsername = 'root';\n    $dbPassword = '';\n    $dbName = 'reviews_db';\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to database\n        $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n        \n        if (!$conn) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Could not connect to the database\");\n        }\n\n        // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n        $checkQuery = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?

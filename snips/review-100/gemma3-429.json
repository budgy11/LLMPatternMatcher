This is *absolutely critical* to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  Without this, a malicious user could inject JavaScript code into your review system, potentially compromising your entire website.  `htmlspecialchars()` converts special characters (like `<`, `>`, `&`, `\"`, and `'`) into their HTML entities, preventing them from being interpreted as code.\n* **Clearer Function Definitions:** The code is now organized into two well-defined functions: `displayUserReviews()` and `addReview()`. This improves readability and maintainability.\n* **`addReview()` Function:**  This function simulates adding a new review.  It includes some basic validation to prevent invalid data from being stored.  **Important:** In a real application, you would store the reviews in a database. This example uses a global array for simplicity, but using a database is highly recommended.\n* **Global Variable (`$reviews`):** The `addReview()` function uses a global variable `$reviews` to store the reviews.  This is a simple way to demonstrate the functionality. However, in a real application, you should avoid using global variables, as they can make code harder to manage and debug. A better approach would be to use a class to encapsulate the reviews.\n* **Comments and Explanations:**  The code is extensively commented to explain each step.\n* **Example Usage:**  The code includes a clear example of how to use the functions.\n* **Validation:**  The `addReview()` function now includes some basic validation to ensure that the review data is valid (e.g., rating between 1 and 5).  **Real applications require much more robust validation** to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities.\n* **Error Handling:** While basic, the `addReview()` function now includes a check for invalid input and displays an error message.  More sophisticated error handling would be needed in a production environment.\n* **Readability:**  The code is formatted consistently for improved readability.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire code into a PHP file (e.g., `reviews.php`).\n2.  **Run the File:**  Place the file in your web server's document root and access it through your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/reviews.php`).\n3.  **Expand the Functionality:**\n    *   **Database Integration:** Replace the global `$reviews` array with database interaction using a database library like PDO or MySQLi.\n    *   **More Validation:** Add more comprehensive validation to the `addReview()` function.\n    *   **Sorting:** Implement sorting of reviews based on rating, date, etc.\n    *   **Pagination:** Add pagination to handle large numbers of reviews.\n    *   **User Authentication:**  Require users to be logged in to add reviews.\n    *   **Styling:**  Add CSS styling to improve the appearance of the reviews.\n\nRemember to always prioritize security and use best practices when developing web applications.  This example provides a basic starting point; adapt it to your specific needs and requirements.  Always sanitize user input and validate data to prevent vulnerabilities.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function\n *\n * This function allows you to create and display user reviews for a product or item.\n * It includes basic functionality for adding, displaying, and potentially\n * sorting reviews.\n *\n * @param string $productName The name of the product being reviewed.\n * @param array $reviews An array of user reviews.

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like username, rating, and comment. That makes sense because each review has these elements.\n\nNext, I should validate the inputs. The username can't be empty and shouldn't have special characters. For the rating, it must be a number between 1 and 5. The comment is optional but if provided, it needs to be cleaned of any HTML tags or malicious code.\n\nThen, I need to connect to the database. I'll use MySQLi for better security and performance. I'll include the configuration file which has the database connection details.\n\nNow, checking if the username exists in the users table is important to prevent reviews from non-existent users. If the user isn't found, I should return an error message.\n\nIf the username exists, I'll prepare an SQL statement to insert the review into the reviews table. Using prepared statements will help prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\nAfter inserting, I'll check if the query was successful. If it was, I'll return a success message; otherwise, an error message about database issues.\n\nI should also handle any exceptions that might occur during the database operations and display appropriate error messages.\n\nFinally, I'll include some example usage to show how the function can be called with different parameters, including optional comments and default ratings if needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will validate inputs, connect securely to the database, check user existence, insert the review, handle errors, and provide feedback on success or failure.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to add a user review\nfunction addReview($username, $rating, $comment = \"\") {\n    // Validate inputs\n    if (empty($username) || !is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid input\";\n    }\n    \n    // Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks\n    $username = htmlspecialchars($username, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars($comment, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n    \n    // Connect to database\n    include('db_config.php'); // Include your database configuration\n    \n    try {\n        // Check if username exists in users table\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ?\");\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $username);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n        \n        if ($result->num_rows == 0) {\n            return \"Username does not exist\";\n        }\n        \n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\";\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"sis\", $username, $rating, $comment);\n        \n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return \"Review added successfully\";\n        } else {\n            return \"Error adding review: \" . $stmt->error;\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        return \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        if ($conn) {\n            $conn->close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$reviewResult = addReview(\"JohnDoe\", 4, \"Great product!\");\necho $reviewResult;\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes the following features:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - Checks that the username is not empty\n   - Ensures rating is a numeric value between 1 and 5\n\n2. **Sanitization**:\n   - Uses `htmlspecialchars()` to clean input data\n   - Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks\n\n3. **Database Operations**:\n   - Connects to the database using mysqli\n   - Checks if the username exists in the users table\n   - Inserts the review into the reviews table\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Returns appropriate error messages for invalid inputs\n   - Catches exceptions and displays meaningful error messages\n   - Properly closes the database connection\n\n5. **Security**:\n   - Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n   - Escapes special characters in input data\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Make sure you have a `db_config.php` file with your database connection details.\n\n2. Create a `users` table and a `reviews` table in your database.\n\n3. The reviews table should include columns for:\n   - id (auto-increment)\n   - username\n   - rating\n   - comment\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n\n```php\n// Required parameters: username and rating\naddReview(\"JaneSmith\", 5);\n\n// With optional comment parameter\naddReview(\"JohnDoe\", 4, \"This is a great product!\");\n\n// Minimum rating (1)\naddReview(\"MikeJohnson\", 1, \"Not satisfied with the quality\");\n\n// Maximum rating (5)\naddReview(\"SarahWilliams\", 5, \"Excellent service and product\");\n```\n\nRemember to:\n\n- Add proper error handling for database connections\n- Implement rate limiting if necessary\n- Add timestamps to track when reviews were created\n- Validate user sessions before allowing them to post reviews\n- Consider adding CAPTCHA protection against spam reviews", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Function to add a user review\nfunction addReview($username, $rating, $comment = \"\") {\n    // Validate inputs\n    if (empty($username) || !is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Invalid input\";\n    }\n    \n    // Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks\n    $username = htmlspecialchars($username, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars($comment, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n    \n    // Connect to database\n    include('db_config.php'); // Include your database configuration\n    \n    try {\n        // Check if username exists in users table\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ?\");\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"s\", $username);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n        \n        if ($result->num_rows == 0) {\n            return \"Username does not exist\";\n        }\n        \n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?)\";\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"sis\", $username, $rating, $comment);\n        \n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return \"Review added successfully\";\n        } else {\n            return \"Error adding review: \" . $stmt->error;\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        return \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        if ($conn) {\n            $conn->close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$reviewResult = addReview(\"JohnDoe\", 4, \"Great product!\");\necho $reviewResult;\n?>\n```", "```php\n// Required parameters: username and rating\naddReview(\"JaneSmith\", 5);\n\n// With optional comment parameter\naddReview(\"JohnDoe\", 4, \"This is a great product!\");\n\n// Minimum rating (1)\naddReview(\"MikeJohnson\", 1, \"Not satisfied with the quality\");\n\n// Maximum rating (5)\naddReview(\"SarahWilliams\", 5, \"Excellent service and product\");\n```"]}

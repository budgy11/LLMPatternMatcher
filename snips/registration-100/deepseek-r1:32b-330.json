{"prompt": "Create a user registration function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user registration function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should outline the basic requirements. The function needs to handle form submissions where users input their details. So, I'll probably start by checking if the form has been submitted using $_POST.\n\nNext, validation is crucial. I can't just trust the user inputs; I need to sanitize them to prevent SQL injection and other attacks. Functions like htmlspecialchars, trim, and stripslashes could be useful here. Also, I should validate each field: name must not contain numbers or special characters, email needs to be in a valid format, password should meet certain criteria like length and containing both letters and numbers.\n\nAfter validation, I need to check if the username or email already exists in the database to avoid duplicates. That means writing a SQL query to select from the users table where username or email matches the input. If either exists, I'll throw an error message.\n\nThen comes password handling. Storing plain text passwords is a no-no, so I should hash it using password_hash(). This makes it secure and irreversible.\n\nSetting up the database connection is another step. Using PDO with prepared statements will help prevent SQL injection. I'll need to include the database configuration file which has the credentials.\n\nInserting the new user into the database requires an INSERT statement. Again, placeholders in the query for security, and using bindParam to substitute the values safely.\n\nHandling errors is important too. If something goes wrong during insertion, like a duplicate entry or a connection issue, I should catch exceptions and display appropriate error messages instead of letting the script crash.\n\nOnce everything is successful, redirecting the user makes sense. Maybe to a login page with a success message so they know their registration was accepted.\n\nI also need to remember that this code should be part of a larger application, so it's good practice to include necessary files and keep functions organized.\n\nWait, I should consider using prepared statements for checking existing users as well, not just the insert. That way, both queries are secure against SQL injection.\n\nAlso, thinking about the structure: maybe creating a separate file for the registration function that includes all these steps. The form on the frontend would post to this script, and based on success or failure, redirect accordingly.\n\nAnother point is session management. After successful registration, starting a session and setting user details could be useful, but that might come later depending on application flow.\n\nI should also consider edge cases: what if the database connection fails? Or if there's an error in sanitization? Proper error handling and logging would help debug issues.\n\nLastly, ensuring that all inputs are properly escaped when inserted into the database to prevent any injection attacks. Using prepared statements takes care of a lot, but being cautious with all user-supplied data is essential.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code step by step: check submission, sanitize inputs, validate each field, check for existing users, hash password, prepare and execute insert query, handle errors, and redirect or display messages as needed.\n</think>\n\nHere's a PHP function for user registration that includes input validation, sanitization, and secure password handling:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Include database configuration file\ninclude('db_config.php');\n\nfunction registerUser() {\n    // Check if form is submitted\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n        $error = array();\n\n        // Get user inputs\n        $username = $_POST['username'];\n        $email = $_POST['email'];\n        $password = $_POST['password'];\n        $confirm_password = $_POST['confirm_password'];\n\n        // Sanitize input data\n        $username = htmlspecialchars(trim(stripslashes($username)));\n        $email = htmlspecialchars(trim(stripslashes($email)));\n\n        // Validate username\n        if (empty($username)) {\n            $error['username'] = \"Username is required\";\n        } else if (!preg_match(\"/^[a-zA-Z ]+$/\", $username)) {\n            $error['username'] = \"Username must contain only letters and spaces\";\n        }\n\n        // Validate email\n        if (empty($email)) {\n            $error['email'] = \"Email is required\";\n        } else if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n            $error['email'] = \"Please enter a valid email address\";\n        }\n\n        // Validate password\n        if (empty($password)) {\n            $error['password'] = \"Password is required\";\n        } else if ($password !== $confirm_password) {\n            $error['password'] = \"Passwords do not match\";\n        } else if (!preg_match(\"/^(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).{8,}$/\", $password)) {\n            $error['password'] = \"Password must be at least 8 characters and contain both letters and numbers\";\n        }\n\n        // If no errors\n        if (empty($error)) {\n            try {\n                // Check if username or email already exists\n                $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username OR email = :email\");\n                $stmt->bindParam(':username', $username);\n                $stmt->bindParam(':email', $email);\n                $stmt->execute();\n                \n                if ($stmt->rowCount() > 0) {\n                    throw new Exception(\"Username or Email already exists.\");\n                }\n\n                // Hash password\n                $hashed_password = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n\n                // Insert into database\n                $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES (:username, :email, :password)\");\n                $stmt->bindParam(':username', $username);\n                $stmt->bindParam(':email', $email);\n                $stmt->bindParam(':password', $hashed_password);\n\n                // Execute the query\n                if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                    // Registration successful\n                    header(\"Location: login.php?success=Registration successful!

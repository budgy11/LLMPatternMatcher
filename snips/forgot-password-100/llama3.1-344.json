{"prompt": "Create a forgot password function using php", "llm_output": "Here is an example of how you can create a \"Forgot Password\" functionality in PHP:\n\n**password_reset.php**\n```php\n<?php\n// Set the email address that will be used to send the password reset link\n$email = $_POST['email'];\n\n// Check if the user exists in the database\n$query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'\";\n$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\nif (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n    // User found, generate a new password and send it to their email\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n    $username = $row['username'];\n    $hashed_password = md5(random_string(8)); // Generate a random salted hash\n\n    // Update the user's password in the database\n    $query = \"UPDATE users SET password = '$hashed_password' WHERE email = '$email'\";\n    mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n    // Send an email with the new password to the user\n    $subject = \"Your new password is: \";\n    $message = \"Dear $username,\\n\\nYour new password is: $hashed_password\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\";\n    mail($email, $subject, $message);\n\n    echo \"A new password has been sent to your email.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Email not found in our records.\";\n}\n?>\n```\n**HTML form (reset_password.html)**\n```html\n<form action=\"password_reset.php\" method=\"post\">\n  <label for=\"email\">Email:</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"><br><br>\n  <input type of=\"submit\" value=\"Reset Password\">\n</form>\n```\n**Explanation**\n\n1. The user submits their email address through the form.\n2. We check if the user exists in our database by querying the `users` table with their email address.\n3. If the user is found, we generate a new random salted hash (MD5) for their password and update it in the database.\n4. We send an email to the user's email address with the new password.\n\n**Security Notes**\n\n* This example uses MD5 hashing, which is considered insecure. You should use a more secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.\n* The password reset link should be sent over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering attacks.\n* Consider implementing additional security measures such as rate limiting on the password reset form.\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\n1. User submits their email address through the form.\n2. Server checks if user exists in database and generates new password if found.\n3. Server sends email with new password to user's email address.\n4. User receives email and logs into account using new password.\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic \"Forgot Password\" functionality, but you should consider implementing additional security measures such as secure hashing and rate limiting to protect your users' accounts.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Set the email address that will be used to send the password reset link\n$email = $_POST['email'];\n\n// Check if the user exists in the database\n$query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'\";\n$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\nif (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n    // User found, generate a new password and send it to their email\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n    $username = $row['username'];\n    $hashed_password = md5(random_string(8)); // Generate a random salted hash\n\n    // Update the user's password in the database\n    $query = \"UPDATE users SET password = '$hashed_password' WHERE email = '$email'\";\n    mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n    // Send an email with the new password to the user\n    $subject = \"Your new password is: \";\n    $message = \"Dear $username,\\n\\nYour new password is: $hashed_password\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\";\n    mail($email, $subject, $message);\n\n    echo \"A new password has been sent to your email.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Email not found in our records.\";\n}\n?>\n```", null]}

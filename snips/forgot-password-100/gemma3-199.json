Secure Token Generation:\n//     - Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., `random_bytes()` in PHP) to generate the token.\n//     -  Ensure the token is long enough and randomly generated.\n\n// 4.  Input Validation & Sanitization:\n//     -  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs (email, new_password) to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.  Use prepared statements.\n\n// 5.  Error Handling:\n//      -  Provide informative error messages to the user if something goes wrong.  Don't expose internal error details.\n\n// 6.  Password Complexity:\n//     - Enforce password complexity requirements (minimum length, special characters, etc.)\n\n// 7.  HTTPS:\n//     - Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n\n// 8.  Session Management:\n//     - If you are using sessions, ensure that session IDs are securely generated and handled.\n\n// 9.  Regular Security Audits:\n//     - Regularly review and update your code to address any new security vulnerabilities.\n\n?>\n```\n\nKey improvements and explanations in this version:\n\n* **`password_hash()`:**  This is *crucially* important.  It uses a secure hashing algorithm (Password Default) to store the new password in the database.  Never, ever store passwords in plain text. The previous answers used placeholder code that would be extremely vulnerable.\n* **PDO for Database Interaction:** The example uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction, which is the recommended approach for modern PHP development.  It's more flexible and secure than older methods.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements with `PDO` to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Prepared statements separate the SQL code from the user input, making it much harder for attackers to inject malicious code.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try...catch` block for error handling during the database operation, preventing the script from crashing and providing a more informative error message.\n* **Clearer Comments and Explanation:**  Detailed comments explain each step and highlight important security considerations.\n* **Security Considerations Section:** Provides a comprehensive list of security considerations and best practices that *must* be implemented for a production environment. This includes rate limiting, token generation, and email verification.\n* **Input Validation Placeholder:** A note that input validation and sanitization are essential, with the understanding that your application will need to implement those checks.\n* **Focus on Secure Password Storage:** The entire purpose of the code is now focused on correctly hashing the password.\n\n**How to Use (Illustrative Example - NOT for Production)**\n\n1.  **Database Setup:**  You'll need a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and a `users` table with columns like `id`, `email`, `password` (for storing the hashed password), and other relevant user information.\n2.  **Database Connection:**  Establish a PDO connection to your database.  Make sure you have the correct credentials.\n3.  **Form Submission:**  Create a form with `email` and `new_password` fields.  When the form is submitted, retrieve the `email` and `new_password` values from the `$_POST` array.\n4.  **Call `forgot_password()`:**  Call the `forgot_password()` function with the email and new password.\n5.  **Display the Result:**  Display the message returned by the function (e.g., \"Password reset successful...\").\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** This code is a simplified example and should be adapted to your specific application and environment. Security is paramount, so thorough testing and careful consideration of all security aspects are absolutely essential.  This code is *not* ready for production without significant security enhancements and proper implementation of the recommendations in the security considerations section.  Always prioritize security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and a 'users' table\n// with a 'password' column (hashed) and an 'email' column.\n\n//  Important:  Never store passwords in plain text!

{"prompt": "Create a forgot password function using php", "llm_output": "Here is an example of how to create a \"Forgot Password\" function in PHP:\n\n**Database Table:**\n\nWe will need a table in our database to store the usernames and passwords. For simplicity, let's assume we have a table called `users` with the following columns:\n```sql\n+---------+----------+-----------+\n| username | email    | password  |\n+---------+----------+-----------+\n```\n**PHP Code:**\n\nFirst, create a file named `forgot_password.php`. This script will be responsible for handling the forgot password functionality.\n```php\n// Include the database connection settings\ninclude 'db_config.php';\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    // Extract the username from the form data\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n\n    // Query the database to retrieve the user's email and password\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        // Retrieve the user's email and password from the result set\n        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        $email = $row['email'];\n        $password = $row['password'];\n\n        // Generate a random password reset token\n        $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));\n\n        // Update the user's database record with the new password reset token\n        $query = \"UPDATE users SET password_reset_token = '$token' WHERE username = '$username'\";\n        mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n        // Send an email to the user with a link to reset their password\n        send_password_reset_email($email, $token);\n    } else {\n        echo 'Error: Username not found';\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to send a password reset email\nfunction send_password_reset_email($email, $token) {\n    // Define the email template\n    $subject = 'Reset Your Password';\n    $body = '\n    <p>Dear '.$username.',</p>\n    <p>You are receiving this email because we received a request to reset your password.</p>\n    <p>To reset your password, click on the following link:</p>\n    <a href=\"' . base_url('reset_password.php?token=' . $token) . '\">Reset Password</a>\n    ';\n\n    // Send the email using PHPMailer or your preferred email library\n    mail($email, $subject, $body);\n}\n```\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis script uses a simple form to collect the username from the user. It then queries the database to retrieve the corresponding email and password associated with that username.\n\nIf the user's record is found in the database, it generates a random password reset token using `random_bytes()`. The token is then stored in the database as part of the user's record.\n\nFinally, an email is sent to the user's email address with a link to reset their password. The link contains the password reset token and can be used by the user to reset their password on the next page (e.g., `reset_password.php`).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Create the database table structure using SQL.\n2. Update the `db_config.php` file with your database connection settings.\n3. Implement the email sending functionality using PHPMailer or a similar library.\n\nNote that this is a basic example, and you may want to add additional security measures such as:\n\n* Salting and hashing passwords\n* Verifying user input data\n* Using HTTPS encryption for emails", "code_blocks": [null, "```php\n// Include the database connection settings\ninclude 'db_config.php';\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    // Extract the username from the form data\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n\n    // Query the database to retrieve the user's email and password\n    $query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        // Retrieve the user's email and password from the result set\n        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        $email = $row['email'];\n        $password = $row['password'];\n\n        // Generate a random password reset token\n        $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));\n\n        // Update the user's database record with the new password reset token\n        $query = \"UPDATE users SET password_reset_token = '$token' WHERE username = '$username'\";\n        mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n        // Send an email to the user with a link to reset their password\n        send_password_reset_email($email, $token);\n    } else {\n        echo 'Error: Username not found';\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to send a password reset email\nfunction send_password_reset_email($email, $token) {\n    // Define the email template\n    $subject = 'Reset Your Password';\n    $body = '\n    <p>Dear '.$username.',</p>\n    <p>You are receiving this email because we received a request to reset your password.</p>\n    <p>To reset your password, click on the following link:</p>\n    <a href=\"' . base_url('reset_password.php?token=' . $token) .

Using a unique, random token (generated with `random_bytes()`) before hashing it with a salt is critical for security. This prevents brute-force attacks on the reset link and ensures the token can only be used once.  `bin2hex()` converts the bytes to a hexadecimal string, which is a common format.\n* **Hashing with Salt:**  The token is now hashed using `password_hash()` *with a salt*.  This is essential to prevent rainbow table attacks.  The salt is generated for each user.\n* **Database Update:** The `UPDATE` query correctly updates the `password_reset_token` column in the `users` table.  This is how the reset link is associated with the user.\n* **Error Handling:** The code includes basic error handling:\n    * **Invalid Email Format:** Checks if the email is a valid email address using `filter_var()`.\n    * **User Not Found:** Handles the case where the email doesn't exist in the database.\n    * **Email Sending Error:**  Includes a check on `mail()` and returns an error message if email sending fails.\n* **Clearer Message:** The messages returned are now more informative to the user.\n* **Complete Example:**  The code now includes a more complete example of how to use the `forgotPassword()` function.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`**: This is the correct way to generate the reset link dynamically. It includes the current script's file name, so that the URL will be correct regardless of the script's location.\n* **No Hardcoded Email:**  The example no longer uses a hardcoded email address, making it more reusable.\n* **Explanation of Security Measures:** The comments clearly explain why each security measure is in place.\n\n**How to Use This Code:**\n\n1. **Database Connection:**  Make sure you have a working database connection established and stored in the `$db` variable.  This example assumes you're using a standard database connection.\n2. **`users` Table:** Ensure you have a `users` table with at least these columns:\n   * `id` (INT, primary key)\n   * `email` (VARCHAR)\n   * `password` (VARCHAR) - *Important: Store passwords in a hashed format.  Do NOT store plain text passwords!*\n   * `salt` (VARCHAR) -  Used to generate the hashed password.\n   * `password_reset_token` (VARCHAR) -  Stores the hashed token for password resets.\n3. **Password Hashing:**  *Crucially*, your code *must* use a strong hashing algorithm (like `password_hash()`) to hash passwords.  Don't use `md5()` or `sha1()` for password hashing.  These are vulnerable.  The example code shows the correct way to do it.\n4. **Form Input:** Create an HTML form with an input field for the user's email address.\n5. **Submit Button:** Add a submit button to the form.\n6. **`forgotPassword()` Function Call:** In your PHP script, when the form is submitted, call the `forgotPassword()` function with the user's email address.\n7. **Output:** Display the message returned by the `forgotPassword()` function to the user.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Session Management:**  When the user clicks the reset link, you'll need to:\n    1. Verify the `password_reset_token` is valid (check if it exists in the database and if it has been used before).\n    2. If valid, generate a new token and update the `password_reset_token` in the database.\n    3.  Send an email with the new reset link.\n* **Token Expiration:** Implement token expiration.  Tokens should have a limited lifetime (e.g., 30 minutes) to prevent attackers from using old reset links.  You can set an expiration time and check it before allowing the user to proceed.\n* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting password reset links.  This can help prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **HTTPS:** *Always* use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.  This protects the token and email content from being intercepted.\n* **Email Server Configuration:**  Make sure your email server is properly configured and that you have the necessary permissions to send emails.\n* **Input Validation:**  Validate *all* user input to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.  `filter_var()` is a good starting point for email validation, but you should also use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n\nThis improved code provides a much more secure and robust password reset functionality. Remember to follow all the security best practices outlined above to protect your users' accounts.  Always prioritize security when dealing with user passwords.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and you have a 'users' table with a 'email' column.\n\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $db) {\n    // Validate email format (optional, but recommended)\n    if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n        return \"Invalid email format.\";\n    }\n\n    // Check if the email exists in the database\n    $result = $db->query(\"SELECT id, password, salt FROM users WHERE email = '$email'\");\n\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        $user = $result->fetch_assoc();\n        $userId = $user['id'];\n        $hashedPassword = $user['password'];\n        $salt = $user['salt'];\n\n        // Generate a unique token (for security)\n        $token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));\n\n        // Hash the token with the salt\n        $hashedToken = password_hash($token, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n\n        // Store the token in the database (associate it with the user's email)\n        $db->query(\"UPDATE users SET password_reset_token = '$hashedToken' WHERE email = '$email'\");\n\n        // Send an email with a link to reset the password\n        $subject = \"Password Reset Link\";\n        $to = $email;\n        $message = \"Click on this link to reset your password: \" . \"<a href='\" . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . \"?reset=$token'>\" . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] . \"?reset=$token</a>\";\n        $headers = \"From: your_email@example.com\" . \"\\r\\n\";\n\n        if(mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers)) {\n          return \"Password reset email sent.

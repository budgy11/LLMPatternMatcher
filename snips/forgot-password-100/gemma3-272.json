This prevents predictable tokens and drastically improves security.\n    * **Hashing the Token:**  The generated token is now hashed using `password_hash()`.  This is absolutely essential.  Storing the raw token in the database is a *major* security vulnerability.  Hashing prevents someone from directly inspecting the database and using the token.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` provides a strong hashing algorithm.\n    * **Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements (`$pdo->prepare()` and `$stmt->execute()`) to prevent SQL injection. This is the standard and *only* secure way to interact with a database in PHP.\n    * **Email Validation:** Added `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` to validate that the provided email address is in a valid format before attempting to insert into the database. This prevents errors and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n* **Error Handling:**\n    * **PDO Exception Handling:** Uses `PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION` to enable proper exception handling.  This makes debugging and error management much easier.  Catches and logs database connection errors.\n    * **Email Sending Error Handling:**  Checks if the email was sent successfully. If not, *deletes* the corresponding entry from the `password_resets` table. This prevents stale reset links from causing issues. Logs errors.\n\n* **Code Clarity and Best Practices:**\n    * **Comments:**  Added extensive comments to explain each step.\n    * **Variable Naming:** Uses descriptive variable names.\n    * **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`:** Correctly uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to construct the reset link, making it portable.\n    * **`urlencode()`:** Uses `urlencode()` when constructing the reset link to properly encode the token, ensuring it's safe to be included in a URL.\n    * **`time() + (2 * 24 * 60 * 60)`:** The token now expires in 2 days (adjust this as needed).\n    * **`charset=utf8mb4`:**  Sets the character set for the PDO connection to `utf8mb4` to support a wider range of characters.\n    * **Logging:** Uses `error_log()` to log errors and warnings, which is essential for debugging.\n\n* **Database Table Structure (Important - Adapt to your system):**\n\n   You'll need a table like this (or similar) to store the reset tokens:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE password_resets (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       user_id INT NOT NULL,  -- Foreign key to your users table\n       token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       expires_at DATETIME NOT NULL,\n       UNIQUE KEY unique_token(token)  -- Ensures no duplicate tokens\n   );\n   ```\n\n* **Example Usage:**  Provided a commented-out example of how to use the `forgotPassword()` function from a form submission.\n\n**How to Use:**\n\n1. **Adapt the Database Structure:**  Create the `password_resets` table in your database.\n2. **Update Credentials:** Change the `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, and `$db_pass` variables to match your database settings.\n3. **Implement the Form:** Create a form on your website that collects the user's email address and submits it to the same PHP file (or a different one that calls `forgotPassword()`).\n4. **Handle the Response:**  After the `forgotPassword()` function is called, display a message to the user indicating whether the password reset email was successfully sent.\n5. **Test Thoroughly:**  Test the entire process, including sending and receiving the reset emails, and verifying that the reset links work correctly.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Never Store Passwords Directly:**  This code focuses on generating reset tokens. You should *never* store passwords directly in the database.  Instead, use this token system to guide the user to a password reset form where they can set a new password.\n* **Session Management:**  Consider using a secure session management system to maintain the user's state during the password reset process.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the password reset functionality (e.g., limit the number of password reset requests from the same IP address within a certain time period).\n* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the user's browser and your server, protecting the token and email content from being intercepted.\n* **Token Expiration:**  Keep the token expiration time relatively short (e.g., 30 minutes to 24 hours) for increased security.\n* **Logging:**  Monitor your logs for suspicious activity related to password resets.\n\nThis improved answer provides a much more secure and robust password reset function, incorporating best practices and addressing critical security concerns.  Remember to tailor the code and database structure to your specific application and security requirements.  Always prioritize security when handling sensitive user data.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// This file assumes you have a database connection established and a `users` table\n// with a `password` column.

These are essential for protecting user accounts.\n* **Password Hashing (Explanation):**  The code explains that you *must* use a strong hashing algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2) to store passwords securely. It shows how to use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`, although it doesn't implement the hashing within this example, because the primary purpose is to demonstrate the database interaction.\n* **Email Verification (Key Concept):**  The code now clearly explains the importance of sending an email to the user with a unique, time-limited token. This is the standard and *correct* approach to password resets.  It's the single most important security improvement you can make.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Added a note about rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **Input Validation:**  Added a note about the need for robust input validation.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  The code uses prepared statements (`$stmt->prepare()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is a critical security measure.\n* **Error Handling (General Note):**  Added a note to implement robust error handling and *never* expose detailed error messages to the user.\n* **Concise Comments:** Improved comments to explain the code's functionality.\n* **`$stmt = null;`:**  Explicitly sets `$stmt` to `null` after use, which is good practice to prevent potential resource leaks.\n* **Example Usage (With Caution):** The example usage is clearly marked as for *testing only* and emphasizes the need to replace the test email and password with valid values for actual testing.\n* **No Plain Text Storage:** The code emphasizes that passwords should *never* be stored in plain text.\n* **Temporary Token (Conceptual):** The comments suggest using a temporary token and explain its purpose - to verify that the user requesting the reset is actually who they claim to be.  This is a key component of a secure password reset implementation.\n\nHow to use and adapt this code:\n\n1. **Replace Configuration:**  Modify the `$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, and `$db_password` variables to match your database credentials.\n2. **Implement Password Hashing:** *Before* using this code in a real application, you *must* implement password hashing using `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` (or a library that provides these functions).  This is non-negotiable for security.\n3. **Implement Email Verification:**  The most important step is to create a secure email verification system.  This involves:\n   * Generating a unique, random token.\n   * Storing the token in the database, associated with the user's email.\n   * Sending an email to the user containing a link with the token.\n   * On the user's side, when they click the link, verify the token against the database to confirm they are authorized to reset the password.\n4. **Test Thoroughly:**  Test the password reset process carefully to ensure it works correctly and that the security measures are effective.\n5. **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling.\n6. **Security Audits:**  Regularly review your code for security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and complete solution for implementing a password reset function in PHP, with a strong emphasis on security best practices.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should always stay up-to-date with the latest security recommendations.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Configuration (Replace with your actual values)\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_database_username';\n$db_password = 'your_database_password';\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $new_password) {\n  // 1.

The code now uses `password_hash()` to hash the new password *before* storing it in the database.  **Never, ever store passwords in plain text.**  `password_hash()` uses a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm (currently PASSWORD_DEFAULT, which is bcrypt) to protect against password cracking.  This is absolutely critical for security.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes basic error handling to check if the database connection is successful and if the password update query was successful.  It also displays the error message to the user.  More robust error handling (logging, more detailed messages) is recommended for production environments.\n\n* **Clearer Comments:**  The comments explain each step of the process and highlight the security aspects.\n\n* **Configuration:** The code now has a configuration section at the top, making it easier to change the database credentials.  **You MUST replace these placeholders with your actual values.**\n\n* **`mysqli` instead of `mysql`:** The code uses `mysqli` which is the recommended method for connecting to MySQL databases in PHP.  The `mysql` extension is deprecated and insecure.\n\n* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$hashed_password`).\n\n* **Example Usage (commented out):**  The code includes an example of how to call the `forgot_password()` function, but it's commented out. This makes it clear how the function is used.  The user will likely submit this via a form.\n\n* **Security Considerations:**\n    * **Email Verification:**  This code *does not* include email verification.  In a real application, you *must* send an email to the user's registered email address containing a link with a token.  This token should be unique and time-limited, and the link should allow the user to set a new password. This is the standard and most secure approach.\n    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force password resets.\n    * **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* user input (email, new password) to prevent SQL injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. Use prepared statements to help with this.\n    * **Session Management:**  Use secure session management techniques to protect user sessions.\n\n**How to use this in a real web application:**\n\n1. **HTML Form:** Create an HTML form with an email input field (e.g., `email`) and a submit button.\n2. **Form Submission:** When the user submits the form:\n   - Get the email address from the form.\n   - Get the new password from the form.\n   - Validate the email address and password (ensure they meet minimum length requirements, etc.).\n   - Call the `forgot_password()` function with the email and new password.\n3. **Email Sending (Crucial):** *Immediately* after calling `forgot_password()`, you *must* implement a function to send an email to the user's registered email address. This email should contain a link with a unique, time-limited token.  This link allows the user to set a new password. This token is the key security element.\n\n**Important Security Notes & Best Practices**\n\n* **NEVER STORE PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT:**  I've emphasized this repeatedly because it's the single most important security consideration.\n* **Token-Based Reset:** Using a token-based reset is the industry standard for good reason. It prevents malicious actors from simply guessing passwords and setting them.\n* **Time-Limited Tokens:** Tokens should expire after a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour) to minimize the window of opportunity for attackers.\n* **Regularly Update Your Code:** Keep your PHP version up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.\n* **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help protect your application from common web attacks.\n\nThis improved response provides a functional `forgot_password()` function with essential security considerations, explains how to use it, and highlights the critical aspects of a secure password reset implementation.  Remember to always prioritize security best practices when developing web applications.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Configuration (Important - Replace with your actual values)\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_database_username';\n$db_password = 'your_database_password';\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgot_password($email, $new_password) {\n    // 1.

The user submits their email address through the `forgot_password.php` form.\n2. If the email exists in the database, a new password is generated using `random_bytes()` and stored in the database with an update query.\n3. An email is sent to the user's email address containing their new password.\n\n**Security Notes:**\n\n* Always validate user input on your form (e.g., checking for malicious SQL code)\n* Store passwords securely using a hash function like `password_hash()`\n* Don't store passwords in plain text or use an insecure hashing algorithm\n* Make sure to test this script thoroughly before deploying it live.\n\nThis is just one way to implement a forgot password system, but there are many other approaches depending on your specific needs.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n$servername = \"localhost\";\n$username = \"username\";\n$password = \"password\";\n$dbname = \"database_name\";\n\n$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n<?php\nrequire_once 'db.php';\n\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Get the user's email address from the form submission\n    $email = $_POST['email'];\n\n    // Check if the email exists in the database\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        // If the user exists, generate a new password and send it to their email address\n        $new_password = bin2hex(random_bytes(16));\n        $to = $email;\n        $subject = \"Reset Your Password\";\n        $message = \"Your new password is: $new_password\";\n\n        mail($to, $subject, $message);\n\n        // Update the user's password in the database\n        $update_sql = \"UPDATE users SET password = '$new_password' WHERE email = '$email'\";\n        $conn->query($update_sql);\n    }\n\n    echo \"Your new password has been sent to your email address.\";\n} else {\n    ?>\n    <html>\n    <body>\n    <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n        Email: <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\"><br><br>\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Reset Password\">\n    </form>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n<?php\n}\n?>\n```"]}

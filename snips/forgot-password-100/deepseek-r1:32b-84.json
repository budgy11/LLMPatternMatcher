{"prompt": "Create a forgot password function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to create a \"forgot password\" function using PHP. I need to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should outline what a typical forgot password feature includes. Usually, it involves sending an email with a reset link or generating a temporary password. Since the user is asking for a PHP function, maybe they want a function that sends such an email.\n\nI'll start by creating a function named something like sendPasswordResetEmail. It should take parameters: recipient email, name, and the site's URL because those are needed to personalize the email and create the reset link.\n\nNext, I need to construct the email content. The subject should be clear, maybe \"Password Reset Request\". The body needs to include a greeting, instructions, and a button with the reset link. Also, there should be some footer text explaining that if they didn't request this, they can ignore it.\n\nI'll build the HTML structure for the email. It's better to use HTML so the email looks good in clients. I'll include styles inline since external CSS might not work everywhere.\n\nThen, I have to set up the headers for the PHP mail function. The Content-Type should be text/html so the email is rendered as HTML. Also, adding a From header with the site's email address makes it look professional.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll use the mail() function in PHP, passing the recipient, subject, message, and headers. Testing this is important to ensure emails are sent correctly.\n\nI should also mention that the user needs to replace placeholders like [your-site.com] with their actual site URL. Additionally, they might want to implement additional security measures like generating a unique reset token or setting up a form for password reset.\n\nFinally, I'll note considerations like email service setup and server configurations so the emails are sent reliably.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a \"Forgot Password\" function in PHP that sends a password reset link to the user's email:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction sendPasswordResetEmail($recipient_email, $user_name, $site_url) {\n    // Set up the email content\n    $subject = \"Password Reset Request\";\n    \n    $reset_link = $site_url . \"/password-reset.php?email=\" . urlencode($recipient_email);\n    \n    $message = \"\n        <html>\n        <head>\n            <title>Password Reset</title>\n        </head>\n        <body style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;'>\n            <h2>Hello \" . htmlspecialchars($user_name) . \",</h2>\n            \n            <p>We received a request to reset your password. Please click the link below to reset it:</p>\n            \n            <a href='\" . $reset_link . \"' style='display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #007bff; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;'>\n                Reset Password\n            </a>\n            \n            <p>If you didn't request this password reset, you can safely ignore this email.</p>\n            \n            <hr style='margin: 20px 0;'>\n            <p>This is an automated message from \" . $site_url . \". Please do not reply to this email.</p>\n        </body>\n        </html>\n    \";\n    \n    // Set up the headers\n    $headers = \"MIME-Version: 1.0\" . \"\\r\\n\";\n    $headers .= \"Content-type:text/html;charset=UTF-8\" . \"\\r\\n\";\n    $headers .= \"From: \" . $site_url . \"<no-reply@\" . str_replace(\"http://\", \"\", $site_url) . \">\" . \"\\r\\n\";\n    \n    // Send the email\n    mail($recipient_email, $subject, $message, $headers);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// sendPasswordResetEmail('user@example.com', 'John Doe', 'https://your-site.com');\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Takes three parameters: recipient's email address, user name, and site URL\n2. Creates a password reset link that will be sent to the user\n3. Constructs an HTML email with:\n   - Personalized greeting\n   - Reset password button/link\n   - Instructions for what to do if they didn't request this\n4. Sends the email using PHP's built-in `mail()` function\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Replace `'https://your-site.com'` with your actual website URL\n2. Make sure you have a corresponding password reset page (`password-reset.php`)\n3. Call the function when the user requests a password reset, passing in their email address and name\n\nSome important notes:\n\n- You'll need to ensure your server is properly configured to send emails\n- The `mail()` function may not work on all hosting environments - you might want to consider using a library like PHPMailer for better reliability\n- This is just the email-sending part of the password reset process - you'll also need to implement:\n  - A form where users can enter their email address to request a reset\n  - A password reset page that accepts the new password\n  - Secure storage and handling of the reset link/credentials\n  - Expiration for the reset links\n\nYou might want to add additional security measures such as:\n\n- Generating a unique reset token for each request\n- Storing the token in your database with an expiration time\n- Hashing any sensitive information before storing it\n- Implementing CSRF protection\n- Adding rate limiting to prevent abuse", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction sendPasswordResetEmail($recipient_email, $user_name, $site_url) {\n    // Set up the email content\n    $subject = \"Password Reset Request\";\n    \n    $reset_link = $site_url . \"/password-reset.php?email=\" . urlencode($recipient_email);\n    \n    $message = \"\n        <html>\n        <head>\n            <title>Password Reset</title>\n        </head>\n        <body style='font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;'>\n            <h2>Hello \" . htmlspecialchars($user_name) . \",</h2>\n            \n            <p>We received a request to reset your password.

Using `random_bytes()` produces cryptographically secure random data.  `bin2hex()` converts it to a hexadecimal string, which is what you should use for tokens.  *Never* use `rand()` or `mt_rand()` for generating tokens.  Those functions are not cryptographically secure.\n    * **Token Length:** 32 bytes (256 bits) is a reasonable length for a password reset token.\n    * **Prevent Token Reuse:**  The generated token is only used *once*.  To prevent token reuse, you *must* have a mechanism to invalidate tokens after they are used, such as updating a \"used_password_reset_token\" column in your database. This example does *not* include that, but it's critical for production.\n* **Email Sending (Placeholder):**  The code includes a placeholder for email sending. *You must implement a proper email sending mechanism*.  This is a critical part of the process.  Consider using a library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer.  Sending emails directly using `mail()` is often unreliable and can be affected by server configuration.\n* **Error Handling:**  Handles invalid email addresses and user not found cases.\n* **Clearer Structure and Comments:**  The code is better organized and has detailed comments to explain each step.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`:** Uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to construct the URL for the reset link. This is generally the most straightforward way to do this.\n* **Input Validation:** Includes a basic email format validation using `filter_var()`.\n* **Database Interaction:**  Uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction, which is the recommended practice.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps (Beyond this basic function):**\n\n1. **Email Sending Implementation:** *Seriously* implement a robust email sending solution.\n   * **PHPMailer:**  A very popular and easy-to-use library:  https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer\n   * **SwiftMailer:** Another popular choice: https://swiftmailer.org/\n\n2. **Token Expiration:**  *Absolutely essential*.  Password reset tokens should expire after a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  Add a `token_expiry` column to your `users` table and update the token in the database when the password is reset.  Also, invalidate the token after it's used.\n\n3. **Database Updates:** Implement the token expiration and invalidation in your database logic.  Consider a \"used_password_reset_token\" column to track whether a token has been used.\n\n4. **Password Reset Link:**  Make sure the URL generated for the reset link points to the correct PHP file and includes the `reset_token` parameter.\n\n5. **Security Best Practices:**\n   * **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n   * **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent malicious websites from submitting form data on behalf of your users.\n\n6. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding your system with password reset requests.\n\n7. **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts, including successes and failures, for auditing and security monitoring.\n\n8. **Password Reset Form:**  Create a form on your website that allows users to request a password reset. The form should include an email field.\n\n9. **Password Reset Page (PHP File):**  Create a separate PHP file (e.g., `reset_password.php`) that handles the password reset process.  This file should:\n   * Receive the `reset_token` from the URL.\n   * Validate the token against the database.\n   * Display a form for the user to enter a new password.\n   * Hash and salt the new password before storing it in the database.\n   * Update the user's password in the database.\n   * Optionally, invalidate the token.\n\n10. **Hashing:**  *Always* use a strong password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) when storing passwords in the database.  *Never* store passwords in plain text.  PHP's `password_hash()` function is the recommended way to hash passwords.\n\nThis expanded explanation and the additional considerations will help you build a secure and robust password reset system. Remember to prioritize security and implement the necessary measures to protect your users' accounts.  Start with the core functionality and then add the more advanced features as needed.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and named $db\n\nfunction forgotPassword($email) {\n  // 1.

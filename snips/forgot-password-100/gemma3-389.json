This prevents attackers from easily obtaining plain-text passwords.  **Never store passwords in plain text.**\n* **Database Connection:** Demonstrates a basic `mysqli` connection. Replace the placeholder database details with your actual configuration.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes `if ($conn->connect_error)` to check for database connection errors and `$conn->error` to display more descriptive error messages.\n* **Input Validation:** The code now includes `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` to validate the email format, preventing SQL injection and other vulnerabilities if the user enters invalid data.\n* **Clearer Structure and Comments:**  The code is more structured with comments explaining each step.\n* **Example Usage with Form:**  Demonstrates how to use the `forgot_password` function and includes a simple HTML form to request a password reset.  **Critical:** This is only for demonstration.  It is *extremely* insecure to display this form directly on a public-facing website.\n* **POST Method:** The example usage uses `$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\"` to ensure that the form data is only processed when the form is submitted, preventing accidental execution on page load.\n* **Correct SQL Query:** The SQL query is constructed carefully to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities (although the input validation helps).\n* **`mysqli` usage:** Uses the modern `mysqli` extension, which is recommended over `mysql` (which is deprecated).\n* **Important Warning:** Includes a prominent warning about the insecurity of displaying the form directly on a public-facing website.\n\n**Important Security Considerations and Best Practices (READ THIS CAREFULLY):**\n\n1. **NEVER STORE PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT:**  This code demonstrates the correct way to store passwords, but it's crucial to understand why this is so important.  Storing passwords in plain text is a *major* security risk. If your database is compromised, attackers will have access to all your users' passwords.\n\n2. **Database Security:**\n   * **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server, protecting credentials during transmission.\n   * **Database User Permissions:** Create a database user with only the necessary permissions (e.g., only the ability to read and write to the `users` table).  Don't use the root account.\n   * **Firewall:**  Configure a firewall to restrict access to your database server.\n\n3. **Email Delivery:**\n   * **Use a Reliable Email Service:** Don't rely on your web server to send emails directly. Use a dedicated email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) to improve deliverability and prevent your server from being overloaded.\n   * **Template Emails:** Use template emails to control the content of the reset password email.\n   * **Token-Based Reset:**  Instead of emailing a password reset link directly, use a unique token that is stored in the database.  This token is then used to generate a temporary, unique reset link.  This is a much more secure approach than using a simple link.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset functionality.\n\n5. **CSRF Protection:**  Use CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent attackers from tricking users into submitting a password reset request.\n\n6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Consider implementing 2FA for added security.\n\n7. **Logging and Monitoring:**  Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) and monitor your application for suspicious activity.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This code is provided for educational purposes only.

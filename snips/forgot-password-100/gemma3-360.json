Using `rand()` or `mt_rand()` is *not* secure.  `random_bytes()` is crucial.  This ensures a high degree of randomness.\n    * **Token Expiry:** The `password_reset_expiry` column is set to the current time plus a reasonable time (e.g., 1 hour). This prevents tokens from remaining valid indefinitely, even if compromised.  Adjust the expiry time based on your security needs.\n    * **No direct email content in the code:** The email content itself is not stored in the PHP code.  This protects the actual message from being exposed.\n\n* **PDO for Database Interaction:**  The code uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction.  PDO is a more modern, robust, and secure way to interact with databases in PHP. It handles quoting and escaping properly, minimizing SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  While not exhaustive, the function checks if the email exists in the database and includes a check for successful email sending.\n\n* **Clearer Logic and Comments:**  The code is structured with clear steps and comments to explain the process.\n\n* **Email Sending:** Uses the `mail()` function to send the email.  *Note:* The `mail()` function's reliability varies depending on your server configuration. For production environments, consider using a dedicated email sending library/service (like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer) for more robust email handling.  These libraries provide better control over email headers, attachments, and error handling.\n\n* **URL Encoding:**  The `urlencode()` function is used to properly encode the token in the URL. This ensures that special characters in the token won't break the link.\n\n* **`global $db;`:**  The `global` keyword is used to access the database connection variable `$db` from within the `forgotPassword` function.  This assumes that the database connection is established outside the function and passed into the function.\n\n* **Example Usage:** Includes an example usage section (commented out) to demonstrate how to call the function.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending Library (Highly Recommended):** As mentioned above, for production use, *always* use a dedicated email sending library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer.  The built-in `mail()` function is notoriously unreliable.  PHPMailer is very popular and easy to use.  SwiftMailer is more complex but offers greater control.\n\n2. **Password Reset Confirmation/Verification:** *Crucially*, you need to implement a mechanism to *verify* that the user actually clicked the reset link and changed their password.  This typically involves:\n   * **A unique, time-limited token:** The token in the URL should expire quickly.\n   * **A confirmation page:**  After the user clicks the link, redirect them to a page where they can enter and confirm their new password.\n   * **Database update:**  Update the user's password in the database only *after* they successfully confirm the new password.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting password reset emails.\n\n4. **Logging:**  Log password reset requests (email, token, timestamp) for auditing and security monitoring.\n\n5. **User Interface (UI):**  Design a user-friendly form on your website for users to initiate the password reset process.\n\n6. **Security Audits:** Regularly audit your code and database security to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Database Design:**  Consider adding columns to your `users` table to store additional security-related information, such as:\n   * `email_verified`:  A boolean to track whether the user's email address has been verified.\n   * `last_password_reset_time`:  The timestamp of the last successful password reset.\n\nThis improved response provides a much more robust and secure foundation for a password reset function in PHP.  Remember to prioritize security best practices and thoroughly test your implementation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and named $db\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user to reset the password for.\n * @return bool True if password reset email was sent successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email)\n{\n    global $db; // Assuming $db is your database connection\n\n    // 1.

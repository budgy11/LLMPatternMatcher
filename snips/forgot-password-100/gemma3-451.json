It includes:\n    * **`password_hash()`:**  Uses the correct `password_hash()` function to securely hash passwords before storing them.  Never store plain text passwords.  The `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` constant utilizes the most current hash algorithm.\n    * **Token Expiry:**  The `reset_token_expiry` column is now used to automatically expire tokens. This is *essential* for security. Without this, a reset token could be used indefinitely. `NOW()` is used to store the current timestamp.\n    * **Random Token Generation:** Uses `random_bytes()` and `bin2hex()` to generate a cryptographically secure random token.  This is far more secure than simpler random number generation methods.\n* **Database Interaction:**  Uses a placeholder `$db` for the database connection.  Replace this with your actual database connection.\n* **Email Sending:**  Includes a basic email sending mechanism using `mail()`.  *Important:*  You'll need to configure `mail()` correctly for your server environment. You may need to install and configure an SMTP server.  Using a library like PHPMailer is *highly* recommended for more robust email handling.\n* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$userId`, `$userEmail`) for better readability.\n* **Error Handling:**  Provides basic error handling (e.g., \"Invalid email address,\" \"User not found\").\n* **Detailed Comments:** The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step.\n* **Important Security Considerations:** The code includes a section with crucial security considerations that *must* be followed. This is critically important to understanding how to build a secure password reset system.\n* **No Dependency on Old, Insecure Functions:**  Removed `md5()` and other deprecated and insecure hashing functions.\n* **Example Usage:**  Includes an example of how to call the `forgotPassword()` function and display the result.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`:**  Correctly uses `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to generate the reset link.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Create a table in your database to store user information, including a `reset_token` and `reset_token_expiry` column.\n\n2. **Connect to the Database:**  Establish a connection to your database using `mysqli` or PDO.\n\n3. **Implement a Form:** Create an HTML form to accept the user's email address.\n\n4. **Call the `forgotPassword()` Function:**  When the user submits the form, call the `forgotPassword()` function with the email address.\n\n5. **Display the Result:**  Display the result (success or error message) to the user.\n\n6. **Reset Link Handling:**  The reset link will redirect the user to the same script (`?reset_token=$token`).  You'll need to implement logic in this script to:\n   - Validate the token.\n   - Check if the token has expired.\n   - Verify the token.\n   - Allow the user to set a new password.\n\n**Important Next Steps (Beyond this code):**\n\n* **PHPMailer:** Use PHPMailer or another email library for more reliable email sending.\n* **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to prevent malicious websites from triggering password resets.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Consider adding 2FA to the password reset process for increased security.\n* **Logging:** Implement robust logging to track all password reset attempts.\n* **Thorough Testing:**  Test the entire password reset process thoroughly, including edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.\n* **User Experience:** Design a user-friendly experience for the password reset process.\n* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your code and infrastructure.\n\nThis revised response provides a secure and functional starting point for implementing a password reset feature in your PHP application.  *Remember to always prioritize security and follow best practices.*\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and a user table with an 'email' and 'password' column.\n\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $db) {\n  // 1.

The `password_hash()` function is used to securely hash the new password before storing it in the database.  *Never* store passwords as plain text.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` is generally the best choice.\n* **Input Validation:**  The code now includes essential input validation:\n    * Checks for empty email or password.  This prevents common errors and potential security issues.  You should add more thorough validation (e.g., email format validation using `filter_var()`, password length restrictions, character set restrictions) in a real application.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()`) and parameter binding (`$stmt->bind_param()`). This is *critical* for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Never directly embed user input into SQL queries.\n* **Error Logging:**  Includes `error_log()` calls to record errors. This is extremely helpful for debugging and monitoring the function's behavior.  You should configure your server to actually write these logs to a file.\n* **Clearer Structure and Comments:** The code is structured with comments to explain each step.\n* **Example Usage (Commented Out):** The example usage is provided but commented out.  This allows you to test the function quickly but emphasizes that you should *never* expose this code directly to users.\n* **Email Function Placeholder:** Provides a placeholder for sending the password reset email. You'll need to integrate this with a real email sending library (e.g., PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, or a service like SendGrid or Mailgun).\n* **Prepared Statement Cleanup:**  Includes `$stmt->close()` to free up resources after the statement has been executed. This is good practice.  It's generally a good idea to close your database connections when you're finished with them, but this example focuses on the SQL operations themselves.\n* **Error Handling:** The code checks if the update was successful (`$stmt->affected_rows`). This helps determine if the password update was performed correctly.\n\nImportant considerations for a production environment:\n\n* **Email Sending:** Integrate with a reliable email sending service.  Consider using a service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES.  These services handle email delivery issues (spam filters, bounces, etc.) much more effectively than sending directly from your server.\n* **Token Generation and Validation:** The code assumes you'll use a token for the reset link.  You *must* implement a robust token generation and validation system.  Tokens should be:\n    * **Unique:** Each token must be unique for each user.\n    * **Random:**  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate tokens.\n    * **Time-Limited:**  Tokens should expire after a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes).\n    * **Securely Stored:** Store the token in the database associated with the user's account.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Limit the number of password reset requests a user can make within a certain time period.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Strongly consider adding 2FA to your password reset flow for increased security.\n* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track password reset activity and identify any suspicious behavior.\n* **User Experience:** Provide clear and helpful instructions to users during the password reset process.\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire password reset flow, including all edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a secure and well-structured foundation for a password reset function in PHP.  Remember to adapt and extend this code based on your specific requirements and security considerations.  Always prioritize security and follow best practices to protect your users' data.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assume you have a database connection established and accessible as $db\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @param string $newPassword The new password to set.\n * @return bool True on success, false on failure.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email, string $newPassword) {\n  // 1.

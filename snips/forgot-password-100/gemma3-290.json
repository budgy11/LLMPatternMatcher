Never store tokens in plain text. `password_hash()` is the correct way to do this in PHP.  It uses a strong hashing algorithm.\n* **Prepared Statements:**  Using `prepare()` and `bind_param()` prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is *essential* for any form that takes user input.  The `bind_param` function correctly escapes the `$email` variable, preventing malicious code from being executed.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes `try...catch` blocks to handle potential database errors (e.g., if the email already exists in the database).  This prevents the script from crashing and provides a more user-friendly experience.\n* **Clearer Logic and Comments:**  The code is structured more logically and includes comments to explain each step.\n* **Database Connection:** Shows how to establish a basic database connection (replace with your actual connection details).  Also includes error handling if the connection fails.\n* **`random_bytes()` for Token Generation:** Uses `random_bytes()` to generate a cryptographically secure random token, which is much stronger than using `rand()` or `mt_rand()`.\n* **`expires_at` Column:** Adds an `expires_at` column to the `password_resets` table.  This is *crucial* because otherwise, a token could be used indefinitely after the user had reset their password.\n* **`bin2hex()`:** Correctly converts the random bytes to a hexadecimal string for the token.\n* **Complete Example:** Provides a more complete example that includes database connection, token generation, storage, and an error handling mechanism.\n* **`login.php` link:** Provides a link back to the login page for convenience.\n\n**Important Considerations & Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending:**  The code *does not* include the actual email sending implementation.  You'll need to use a mail function (like `mail()`, `sendmail`, or a library like PHPMailer) to send the reset password email.  PHPMailer is recommended for more complex email setups.\n\n2. **PHPMailer (Recommended Email Library):**  Using a dedicated email library like PHPMailer is *highly recommended* for robust email sending. It handles SMTP configuration, authentication, and more. You can install it with Composer: `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`\n\n3. **Password Reset Link Generation:**  Generate a unique, temporary link that includes the token.  The URL should look something like `https://yourwebsite.com/reset_password.php?reset_password_request=your_unique_token`.\n\n4. **Token Expiration:**  Set a reasonable expiration time for the token (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  After this time, the token should be invalidated and the user should be prompted to request a new reset password link.\n\n5. **User Interface:**  Create a form on your website to allow users to request a password reset. The form should take the user's email address as input.\n\n6. **Database Table:** You'll need to create a database table to store the reset tokens. A suitable structure would be:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE password_resets (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n       expires_at DATETIME NOT NULL,\n       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n   ```\n\n7. **Security Auditing:** Regularly audit your code for security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and robust password reset function, incorporating essential security practices and best practices.  Remember to replace the placeholder values (database connection details, etc.) with your actual values.  Always prioritize security when handling user credentials.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and a 'users' table with a 'email' column.\n// Replace these with your actual database connection details and table name.\n\n// Database configuration\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'your_database_name';\n$db_user = 'your_database_user';\n$db_pass = 'your_database_password';\n\n// Check if the reset_password_request parameter is set in the URL\nif (isset($_GET['reset_password_request'])) {\n  // 1.

This is *essential* for token security.  Using `mt_rand()` or `rand()` is insecure for generating tokens.\n    * **`PDO` for database interaction**:  Using PDO (PHP Data Objects) is the recommended way to interact with databases in modern PHP applications. It provides a consistent interface and helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n    * **Prepared Statements**: The `prepare()` and `execute()` methods are *critical* for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This ensures that user input is treated as data and not as part of the SQL query, mitigating risks.\n    * **Token Expiry**:  The `expires` column in the database and the `$reset_password_link_expiry` parameter provide an expiry time for the token.  This is vital for security.  Without an expiry, a compromised token could be used indefinitely.\n\n* **Error Handling and Logging:**\n    * **`try...catch` block**:  The `try...catch` block gracefully handles potential `PDOException` errors (e.g., database connection problems, invalid query).  This prevents the script from crashing.\n    * **`error_log()`**: Logs errors to the server's error log, making it easier to debug problems. This is *extremely* important for production environments.\n    * **Clear Error Messages**:  The error messages are more informative, indicating the specific problem.\n\n* **Code Clarity and Readability:**\n    * **Comments**:  Comprehensive comments explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n    * **Variable Names**: Uses descriptive variable names (e.g., `$reset_password_link_expiry`).\n    * **String Typing**:  Uses type hints (`string`) for function parameters, improving code clarity and enabling static analysis.\n\n* **Best Practices:**\n    * **Database Connection**: The example includes a basic PDO connection.  *Replace* the placeholders with your actual database credentials.\n    * **HTTP_HOST**: Uses `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` to generate the reset link, making the link work regardless of the domain or subdomain.\n    * **Email Sending**:  Uses `mail()` for sending emails.  *Important*:  `mail()` is a relatively simple function; for production applications, consider using a dedicated email library (like PHPMailer) which offers more features and better error handling and deliverability.\n    * **Clear Separation of Concerns:**  The function only handles the password reset process; it doesn't include the logic for displaying the reset form or handling the user's new password.\n\n* **Important Considerations for Production:**\n\n    * **Email Library (PHPMailer):**  As mentioned above, using `mail()` directly can be unreliable. PHPMailer is a much better choice for sending emails in production, as it handles many details (like SMTP settings, attachments, and error handling) more robustly.\n    * **Session Management:**  You'll need to manage the session of the user who requested the password reset.  This allows you to track the reset link and potentially handle the password update.\n    * **Password Reset Form (`reset_password.php`):**  You'll need to create a form (`reset_password.php`) to allow the user to enter their new password.  This form should also validate the token and update the user's password in the database.  *Crucially*, this form must securely handle the new password before updating the database.\n    * **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse, consider implementing rate limiting on the password reset function.  This will limit the number of password reset requests a user can make within a given time period.\n    * **Security Audits:** Regularly perform security audits of your code to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.\n\nHow to use the function (assuming you have `reset_password.php`):\n\n1.  **Call `forgot_password()`**:  When a user requests to reset their password, call the `forgot_password()` function, passing in the user's email address.\n2.  **Send Email**: The function will generate a token, store it in the database, and send an email to the user with the reset link.\n3.  **User clicks link**:  The user clicks the reset link in the email. This will redirect them to `reset_password.php`.\n4.  **`reset_password.php`**: This page will:\n    *   Verify the token from the URL.\n    *   Display a form to the user to enter their new password.\n    *   When the user submits the form, validate the new password.\n    *   Update the user's password in the database using the validated token and new password.\n    *   (Optionally) Destroy the token record from the database.\n\nThis revised response provides a robust and secure password reset function, incorporating best practices for PHP development and security.  Remember to replace the placeholder database connection details and email sending with your actual configurations.  Always prioritize security when handling user passwords.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Forgotten Password Function\n *\n * This function handles the process of resetting a user's password.\n * It generates a unique token, sends an email with a password reset link,\n * and optionally allows the user to reset their password using that link.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user who wants to reset their password.\n * @param string $reset_password_link_expiry  The expiry time (in seconds) for the password reset link.

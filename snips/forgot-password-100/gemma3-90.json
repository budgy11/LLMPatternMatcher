Using `random_bytes` is far more secure than `rand()` or `mt_rand()` for generating tokens.\n    * **Temporary Table:**  Crucially, the token and user ID are now stored in a *temporary table*. This is a significant security improvement.  It prevents a malicious user from directly querying the permanent `users` table to see the token.  The temporary table is dropped after use.\n    * **Token Validation (Crucial for Production):**  *Important:* The provided code *doesn't* include the essential step of validating the token when the user clicks the reset link. This is a *critical* security omission.  In a real application, you *must* check if the token exists in the `reset_tokens` table and that it hasn't already been used.  If the token is invalid or expired, you should reject the reset request.  I've added a comment to highlight this.\n    * **No Usernames in Email:** The email content *only* contains the reset link. Never include the user's username or other personal information in the email.\n\n* **Clearer Structure and Comments:** The code is thoroughly commented, explaining each step. The function is well-defined and separated from the example usage.\n\n* **Error Handling:** Includes a basic `connect_error` check for the database connection.\n\n* **Example Usage:**  The example usage is separated from the function definition and clearly marked as a demonstration.\n\n* **Database Independence:**  The code is designed to be adaptable to different database systems, but you will need to adjust the connection string if your database uses a different driver.\n\n* **Mail Function:**  The code uses the `mail()` function, which is a standard PHP function for sending emails.  However, `mail()` can be unreliable depending on your server's configuration.  Consider using a dedicated email library (e.g., PHPMailer) for more robust email sending.\n\n* **Clearer Variables:** Uses more descriptive variable names (e.g., `$user_id`, `$username`).\n\n* **Correct SQL:** The SQL query is correct and efficient.\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace the placeholder database credentials (`$host`, `$username`, `$password`, `$database`) with your actual values.  Also, replace `your_email@example.com` with your email address for sending the password reset email.\n2. **Create the `users` table:**  Make sure you have a `users` table in your database with at least `id`, `username`, and `email` columns.\n3. **Implement Token Validation (MOST IMPORTANT):**  This is the *most important* step for security. When a user clicks the reset link, you *must* check if the token exists in the `reset_tokens` table and if it's valid. If the token is invalid or expired, display an error message to the user.\n4. **Integrate with your Application:**  You'll need to integrate this function into your application's code.  Typically, you'd have a form where the user enters their email address. When the user submits the form, you'd call the `forgot_password()` function and display the result.\n\n**Important Security Considerations (Beyond the code):**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **Password Reset Link Expiration:**  Set an expiration time for password reset links (e.g., 30 minutes) to reduce the risk of misuse.\n* **User Interface:**  Design your application's user interface carefully to minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities.\n* **Regular Updates:** Keep your PHP version and any related libraries up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis improved version provides a more secure and robust foundation for a password reset functionality.  However, remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should continuously monitor and improve your application's security posture.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database credentials (Replace with your actual credentials)\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'your_username';\n$password = 'your_password';\n$database = 'your_database';\n\n// Function to reset password\nfunction forgot_password($email) {\n  // 1.

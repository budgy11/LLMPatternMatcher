This is *crucial* for security.  Simple random numbers are not sufficient for this purpose.\n    * **Database Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()`) and parameter binding (`$stmt->bind_param()`) to *prevent SQL injection attacks*.  *Never* directly concatenate user input into SQL queries. This is the most important security best practice.\n    * **Temporary Table:**  The most critical security improvement.  By storing the token and user ID in a temporary table (`password_resets`), you can:\n        * **Prevent Token Reuse:**  The token is no longer tied to the user directly in the user table. This prevents an attacker from finding the token in the user table and using it for someone else.\n        * **Track Reset Attempts:**  You can easily count the number of reset attempts for a user.\n        * **Revoke Tokens:** You can implement logic to delete old tokens to further reduce risk.\n* **Error Handling:** The code now checks if the email exists in the database and returns `false` if it doesn't, giving the calling code a clear indication of the failure.\n* **Database Interaction:**  The code clearly demonstrates how to interact with a database connection (`$db`).  It uses `$db->prepare()`, `$stmt->bind_param()`, `$stmt->execute()`, and `$result->fetch_assoc()` which are standard and efficient ways to interact with a database in PHP.\n* **Clearer Logic and Comments:**  The code is better organized with comments explaining each step.\n* **Example Usage:**  The example usage shows how the `forgotPassword()` function would be called and how the result would be handled.\n* **`time() + 3600`:** The `expires_at` column is set to `time() + 3600`, which means the token will expire in one hour. This is standard practice for password reset links.\n* **`$db->insert_id`:**  Gets the ID of the newly inserted row in the temporary table, allowing you to easily track the reset request.\n* **No Direct User ID Usage:** Avoids directly using the user's ID for security.  Uses the temporary table to store the token and user ID, which is the correct approach.\n* **Code Clarity:**  Uses more descriptive variable names and follows coding best practices.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Email Sending:** The example doesn't include the actual email sending logic (using `mail()`). You'll need to implement this part.  Consider using a dedicated email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) for better reliability and deliverability.\n\n2. **Password Reset Form:** You'll need a form on your website where users can enter their email address to initiate the password reset process.  This form should validate the email address and submit it to your PHP script.\n\n3. **Password Reset Link Validation:** On the password reset page, you'll need to:\n   * Verify that the token is valid (exists in the `password_resets` table).\n   * Check that the token has not expired.\n   * Retrieve the user's password hash from the `users` table using the token.\n\n4. **Password Update Page:** Create a page where the user can enter a new password. Validate the new password (e.g., ensure it meets complexity requirements).  Update the user's password hash in the `users` table.\n\n5. **Security Hardening:**\n   * **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the user's browser and your server.\n   * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n   * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input.\n   * **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n\n6. **Deletion of Old Tokens:** Implement logic to periodically delete old password reset tokens from the `password_resets` table to minimize the risk of old tokens being used.\n\nThis improved response provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a password reset feature in your PHP application.  Remember to carefully consider all the security implications and follow best practices throughout the development process.  This is a *starting point*; you will need to add additional features and security measures based on your specific requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and user information stored in a table (e.g., 'users') with columns like 'email' and 'password_hash'\n\nfunction forgotPassword($email, $db) {\n  // 1.

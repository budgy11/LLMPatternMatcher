The `forgot_password.php` file is used to handle the forgot password form submission.\n2. When a user submits the forgot password form, their email and username are validated and checked against the database.\n3. If a match is found, a new password reset token is generated and stored in the database for that user.\n4. An email with a password reset link (including the password reset token) is sent to the user.\n5. The `reset_password.php` file is used to handle the password reset form submission.\n6. When a user submits the password reset form, their new password and confirm new password are validated and checked against each other.\n7. If they match, the user's password is updated in the database using the SHA2 hashing function.\n\nNote: This code uses a simple email-based password reset system. In a real-world application, you would want to use a more secure method of verifying the user's identity before updating their password. Additionally, this code assumes that the users table has a `username` and `email` column, as well as a `password_reset_token` column.\n\n**Security Notes:**\n\n* Make sure to replace `'localhost'`, `'username'`, `'password'`, and `'database_name'` with your actual database connection settings.\n* Use a more secure method of verifying the user's identity before updating their password (e.g. using a one-time code sent via SMS or email).\n* Use a salted SHA2 hashing function to store passwords securely.\n* Make sure to validate and sanitize all user input data to prevent SQL injection attacks.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nrequire_once 'config.php'; // database connection settings\n\n// check if the user has submitted the form\nif (isset($_POST['submit'])) {\n  $email = trim($_POST['email']);\n  $username = trim($_POST['username']);\n\n  // validate the email and username\n  if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n    echo \"Invalid email address\";\n    exit;\n  }\n\n  // query to retrieve user's password reset token\n  $query = \"\n    SELECT *\n    FROM users\n    WHERE email = '$email' AND username = '$username'\n  \";\n  $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);\n\n  if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n    // get the user's data from the result set\n    $user_data = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n    $password_reset_token = $user_data['password_reset_token'];\n\n    // generate a new password reset link and send it to the user via email\n    $new_password_reset_link = \"http://example.com/reset-password.php?token=\" . urlencode($password_reset_token);\n\n    // send an email with the password reset link\n    mail(\n      $email,\n      'Password Reset',\n      \"\n        You have been requested to reset your password.

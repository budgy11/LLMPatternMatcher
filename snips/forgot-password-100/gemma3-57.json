This is *much* more secure than `rand()` or `mt_rand()` which are predictable.\n* **Prepared Statements:** Uses prepared statements (`$conn->prepare()`, `$stmt->bind_param()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is crucial for security.  Never directly embed user input into SQL queries.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling using `error_log()` if the database insert fails.  Crucially, *always* log errors for debugging.\n* **Expiration:**  Sets an expiry date for the password reset token (e.g., 1 hour).  This prevents attackers from using compromised tokens.  `date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\", time() + 3600)` creates a timestamp 1 hour in the future.\n* **Clearer Code:**  The code is well-commented and structured for readability.\n* **Example Usage:**  Includes an example of how to call the function, showing how to get the email from a form.\n* **Production-Ready Considerations (Important!)**\n   * **Email Sending:**  The `mail()` function is notoriously unreliable and not recommended for production environments.  Use a robust email sending library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer. These libraries handle SMTP configuration, error handling, and ensure that emails are delivered correctly.\n   * **Input Validation/Sanitization:** *Always* validate and sanitize user input (email address especially) before using it in any database query.  This helps prevent malicious input from causing problems.\n   * **CSRF Protection:** Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent attackers from forging requests.  This usually involves adding a unique token to the form and verifying it on the server.\n   * **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging for all security-related events (failed login attempts, password resets, etc.).\n   * **HTTPS:** Ensure your website is served over HTTPS to protect passwords during transmission.\n   * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\nHow to use the code:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Make sure you have a database table `users` with an `id` (primary key), `email`, and `password` column.\n2. **Password Resets Table:** Create a table named `password_resets` with columns `user_id` (foreign key referencing `users.id`), `token` (unique string), and `expiry` (timestamp).\n3. **Integrate:**  Copy the PHP code into your project.\n4. **Form:** Create an HTML form to collect the user's email address.\n5. **Submit:**  When the form is submitted, the `forgot_password()` function will be called.\n6. **Email:** The function will generate a reset token, store it in the `password_resets` table, and send an email to the user with a link to reset their password.\n7. **Reset Link:** The user will click the link in the email. This will typically redirect them to a page on your website where they can enter their new password.\n\nRemember to replace placeholder values (like `yourdomain.com` and `your_email@example.com`) with your actual values.  And *always* prioritize security when dealing with user passwords.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and a 'users' table with a 'email' column.\n\n//  This is a basic example and should be adapted to your specific setup.\n//  For production, you should always sanitize inputs, use prepared statements,\n//  and implement proper security measures.\n\nfunction forgot_password($email) {\n  // 1.

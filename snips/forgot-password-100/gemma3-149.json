This is a fundamental security practice. `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` ensures compatibility with modern password hashing algorithms.\n\n* **Clearer Example Usage:** The example usage is now much clearer and emphasizes that it's for *testing purposes only*.  It also includes comments explaining what the code is doing.  A warning about production use is added.\n\n* **Database Placeholder:** The code clearly marks where you would replace the simple `$users` array with your actual database interaction logic. This makes it easy for you to adapt the code to your specific setup.\n\n* **URL Encoding:** Uses `urlencode($token)` when constructing the reset URL. This ensures that the URL is properly formatted and that any special characters in the token are safely transmitted.  This prevents issues if the token contains characters that are not allowed in URLs.\n\n* **Error Handling (Basic):** While a full error handling system is beyond the scope of this simple example, the `mail()` function's return value is checked to provide a basic indication of whether the email was sent successfully.  Real applications would need more robust error handling, including logging and more specific error checks.\n\n* **Comments and Explanation:**  Added extensive comments to explain each step of the process, making the code easier to understand and modify.\n\n* **`mail()` function usage:** The code uses the standard `mail()` function, which is common in PHP.  *Important:*  The `mail()` function's behavior depends on your server's configuration.  Some servers might require specific extensions or settings to be enabled for email sending to work correctly.\n\n* **`reset_password.php`:** The example clearly states the need to implement the `reset_password.php` file, which handles the form and password reset logic.  This separation of concerns is good practice.\n\n* **Best Practices:**  This improved version adheres to security best practices regarding token storage and URL construction.\n\n**Important Considerations & Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Database Integration:** This is the *most* important next step.  Replace the simple `$users` array with proper database code to store and retrieve user information.  Use a safe and secure database connection.\n\n2. **`reset_password.php` Implementation:** You *must* create the `reset_password.php` file.  This file will:\n   - Receive the token from the URL.\n   - Verify the token's validity (check if it's been used before and still exists in the database).\n   - Present a form for the user to enter a new password.\n   - Hash the new password using `password_hash()` *before* storing it in the database.\n   - Clear the token from the database after the password reset is complete.  This is crucial to prevent replay attacks.\n\n3. **Email Sending Configuration:**  Configure your PHP installation to properly send emails.  This might involve setting up SMTP credentials (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, etc.) or using a local email server.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the password reset functionality.\n\n5. **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your code and infrastructure.\n\n6. **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to protect the token and password during transmission.\n\n7. **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to help diagnose and resolve issues.\n\n8. **Time to Live (TTL) for Tokens:**  Consider implementing a time-to-live (TTL) for tokens.  After a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes), the token should expire to further enhance security.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and robust foundation for implementing a forgotten password feature in PHP.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should continually review and update your code to address emerging threats.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Forgot Password Function\n *\n * This function generates a unique token and sends an email with a link\n * to reset the user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user who forgot their password.\n * @param string $reset_password_url The URL where the reset password form is located.\n * @param string $from_email The email address to send the password reset email from.\n * @param string $from_name The name to display in the email from.\n * @return bool True if email sent successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgot_password(string $email, string $reset_password_url, string $from_email, string $from_name): bool\n{\n    // 1.

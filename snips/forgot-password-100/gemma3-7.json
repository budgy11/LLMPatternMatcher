The code *now* validates that both `$email` and `$token` are provided. This prevents malicious users from submitting empty values to trigger a password reset.  This is the *first* check and significantly improves security.\n* **URL Encoding:** `urlencode($token)` is used to properly encode the token in the reset link. This ensures that special characters in the token are handled correctly, preventing issues with URLs and security vulnerabilities.\n* **Error Logging:**  `error_log()` is used to log errors and debugging information.  This is crucial for troubleshooting why a password reset might fail. It's much better than just silently failing.  You *must* configure your PHP environment to handle error logging correctly.\n* **Clearer Comments and Docblock:**  Improved comments and a detailed docblock explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.  This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n* **`mail()` function:**  Uses PHP's built-in `mail()` function to send the email. *However*,  `mail()` is notoriously unreliable and has many configuration dependencies that vary across servers. **IMPORTANT:  For a production environment, *do not* rely solely on PHP's `mail()` function.**  It's almost always better to use a dedicated email sending library or service (e.g., PHPMailer, SwiftMailer, SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES). These offer better reliability, deliverability, and features.\n* **Example Usage:**  The example usage is kept but clearly marked as *for testing purposes only*.  You'll replace the example data with your actual user email and the URL where the password reset page is located.\n* **Important Considerations (NOT included in the code, but crucial):**\n    * **Database Integration:** This function *only* generates the reset link.  You'll need to integrate this with your database to:\n        * Check if the user exists.\n        * Create a temporary token in the database associated with the user's ID.\n        *  If the reset link is clicked, verify the token against the database to confirm the user.\n    * **Token Expiration:**  Implement an expiration time for the tokens (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).  After the token expires, it should be invalidated from the database.\n    * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint.\n    * **HTTPS:**  *Always* use HTTPS for password reset pages to protect the token from being intercepted.\n    * **Security Headers:**  Set appropriate security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`) in your web server configuration.\n    * **Password Complexity Requirements:**  Enforce password complexity requirements during the password reset process.\n    * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Consider implementing 2FA for enhanced security.\n\nHow to use this function (conceptual):\n\n1. **User Requests Reset:** The user enters their email address and clicks a \"Forgot Password\" link.\n2. **Generate Token:** The PHP script generates a unique, random token (e.g., a string of characters).\n3. **Store Token:** The token is stored in your database, associated with the user's ID.\n4. **Build Reset Link:** The script constructs the reset link, including the token.\n5. **Send Email:** The email is sent to the user's email address.\n6. **User Clicks Link:** The user clicks the reset link.\n7. **Verify Token:** The application checks if the token exists in the database for that user.\n8. **Update Password:** If the token is valid and hasn't expired, the user is prompted to enter a new password.  The database is updated with the new password.\n9. **Invalidate Token:** The token is deleted from the database to prevent unauthorized password resets.\n\nThis revised answer provides a more robust and secure starting point for implementing a password reset function in PHP.  Remember to *always* prioritize security and thoroughly test your implementation.  Using a proper email sending library is *highly* recommended for production.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Forgot Password Function\n *\n * This function allows users to reset their password.\n * It generates a unique, secure token and sends an email with a link to \n * a password reset page.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user.\n * @param string $token  A unique token to associate with the password reset request.\n * @param string $baseUrl The base URL of the password reset page.\n * @return bool True if the email was sent successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email, string $token, string $baseUrl)\n{\n    // Validate email and token (important for security)\n    if (empty($email) || empty($token)) {\n        error_log(\"Forgot Password: Missing email or token.\"); // Log for debugging\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Build the reset link\n    $resetLink = $baseUrl . \"?token=\" . urlencode($token);\n\n    // Email setup\n    $to = $email;\n    $subject = 'Password Reset';\n    $message = \"Please click the following link to reset your password: \" . $resetLink;\n    $headers = \"From: Your Website <admin@yourwebsite.com>\"; // Replace with your email address\n\n    // Send the email (using PHP's built-in mail function -  Consider alternatives for production)\n    if (mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers)) {\n        error_log(\"Forgot Password: Email sent to \" . $email);\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        error_log(\"Forgot Password: Failed to send email to \" . $email);\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example Usage (For testing purposes - Remove or adjust for your application)\n// $email = \"testuser@example.com\";\n// $token = \"abcdef1234567890\";\n// $baseUrl = \"http://localhost/reset_password/\";  // Replace with your password reset URL\n\n// if (forgotPassword($email, $token, $baseUrl)) {\n//     echo \"Password reset email sent to \" . $email;\n// } else {\n//     echo \"Failed to send password reset email.\";\n// }\n\n?>\n```"]}

These are *not* suitable for generating tokens as they are predictable.\n    * **`bin2hex()`:** Converts the random bytes to a hexadecimal string, which is the standard representation for tokens.\n    * **Database Prepared Statements:**  The code now uses prepared statements with `PDO` to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is *crucial* for security.\n    * **Error Handling:** Includes a `try...catch` block for the database query to handle potential errors gracefully, logging the error and returning `false`.  This prevents the script from crashing.\n    * **HTTPS:** **Important:**  This script should *always* be served over HTTPS to protect the token from being intercepted.\n\n* **Token Generation:**\n    * **32-byte Token:** Generates a 32-byte token, providing a much higher level of entropy and security.\n    * **`bin2hex()`:**  Uses `bin2hex()` to convert the bytes to a hexadecimal string.\n\n* **Database Interaction (PDO):**\n    * **`PDO`:** Uses `PDO` for database interaction, offering greater flexibility and security compared to older methods.\n    * **Prepared Statements:** Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n    * **Connection Details:** Clearly indicates where you need to replace placeholders with your actual database credentials.\n\n* **Email Sending:**\n    * **Placeholder:** Includes a placeholder for your email sending logic.  You'll need to replace this with your chosen email sending library or service.\n    * **`mail()`:** Uses the `mail()` function.  This is a common method but can be unreliable depending on your server configuration. Consider using a more robust email sending library (e.g., PHPMailer, SwiftMailer).\n\n* **Token Expiration (Important Considerations):**\n    * **Clear Explanation:** The code includes an explanation of why token expiration is necessary and provides an *example* of how to do it with `sleep()`.  However, it *strongly emphasizes* that this is a basic example and *not suitable for production*.\n    * **Robust Expiration:**  **Critical:** In a production environment, you should use a more robust mechanism for token expiration, such as a task queue (e.g., Laravel's queue system, Celery) or a database column to track the expiration time.\n    * **Security:**  The `sleep()` example is dangerous in production.  It blocks the execution of the script until the token expires, which can impact performance.\n\n* **Code Structure & Readability:**\n    * **Clear Comments:**  Improved comments explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n    * **Variable Naming:**  Uses descriptive variable names.\n    * **Function Structure:** Encapsulates the password reset logic in a `forgotPassword()` function for better organization and reusability.\n\n* **Error Handling:** The addition of `try...catch` block to handle PDO exceptions. This is crucial for a robust application.\n\n* **Testing:** The example usage is wrapped in `if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\")` to ensure it only runs when the form is submitted. This makes the example easier to test.\n\n**Important Security Notes & Best Practices:**\n\n1. **HTTPS:** *Always* use HTTPS to protect the token during transmission.\n2. **Email Sending Libraries:** Use a dedicated email sending library like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer for more reliable and secure email sending.\n3. **Token Expiration:**  Implement a robust token expiration mechanism.\n4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset functionality.\n5. **Logging:**  Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n6. **Database Security:**  Secure your database connection with strong passwords and appropriate access controls.\n\n**To use this code:**\n\n1. **Install PDO:** Make sure your PHP installation has PDO enabled.\n2. **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace the placeholder database credentials (`your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database_name`) with your actual database credentials. Also, replace `your_email@example.com` with your email address.\n3. **Email Sending:**  Integrate your chosen email sending library or service.\n4. **Test:**  Thoroughly test the code, including edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities.\n5. **Deployment:**  Deploy the code to a secure server.  *Always* use HTTPS.\n\nThis revised response provides a significantly more secure and robust solution for handling password resets in PHP.  Remember to prioritize security and thoroughly test your implementation.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Handles the forgot password process.\n *\n * This function generates a unique token, stores it in a database,\n * sends an email with a password reset link, and sets the token to expired.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user requesting the reset.\n * @return bool True if the process was successful, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword(string $email): bool\n{\n    // 1.

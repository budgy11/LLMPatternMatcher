You *must* use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt to store password hashes.  This example does not include the hashing itself because it's beyond the scope of the password reset function but is crucial.\n    * **Token Generation:** Generates a 32-byte random token using `random_bytes()`.  This is more cryptographically secure than using `mt_rand()` or `rand()`.\n    * **Token Expiry:**  Adds a `password_reset_token_expiry` column to the database and sets an expiry time.  This is *essential* for security.  Without an expiry, a compromised token could be used indefinitely.\n    * **Input Validation:** Basic email validation using `filter_var()`. You'll likely want more robust validation in a production environment.\n* **Database Interaction (PDO):** Uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction.  PDO is a modern and more secure way to interact with databases compared to older methods like `mysql_*` functions, which are deprecated and insecure.  The example now includes a placeholder for database credentials. **Replace these placeholders with your actual database details.**\n* **Token Storage:**  The code correctly stores the token in the database associated with the user's email.\n* **Email Sending:** Uses the PHP `mail()` function for sending emails.  *Important:* `mail()` is simple but can be unreliable.  For production environments, use a more robust email sending library like SwiftMailer or PHPMailer, which offer better delivery rates, tracking, and error handling.\n* **Clearer Comments and Explanation:** The code includes more detailed comments to explain each step.\n* **Example Usage (commented out):**  Provides an example usage section, but it is commented out to prevent accidental execution during development or when running in a production environment.\n* **Error Handling:**  While basic, the code checks if the user exists in the database before attempting to store the token.\n* **Modern PHP Features:** Uses modern PHP features like `PDO::PARAM_STR` for parameter binding, which improves security and performance.\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Modify the database connection details (`host`, `username`, `password`, `your_database_name`) to match your database setup.\n2. **Implement Hashing:**  *Crucially*, you must implement password hashing in your application.  Use a library like `password_hash()` to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.  Then, during the password reset process, you'll need to verify the hashed token against the user's stored hash.\n3. **Email Sending:** Replace the `mail()` function with a reliable email sending library for production.\n4. **Password Reset Form:**  You'll need a form on your website that allows users to enter their email address and initiate the password reset process.\n5. **Password Reset Link:** After the password reset email is sent, the user will click the link in the email, which will redirect them to a page where they can enter their new password.  This new password should be hashed and stored in the database.\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the password reset endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks.\n* **CSRF Protection:**  Protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server.\n* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your application.\n* **User Education:** Educate users about password security best practices.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a functional password reset function along with detailed security considerations and clear instructions on how to integrate it into your application. Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices to protect your users' accounts.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Ensure this is running on the server-side (e.g., a web server)\n//  This code is for demonstration purposes and should be adapted for a\n//  production environment with proper security measures.\n\n//  Important:  NEVER store passwords directly in your code or database.\n//  Always hash passwords using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt.\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user requesting a password reset.\n * @return bool True if a password reset email was sent successfully, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgotPassword($email) {\n  // Validate the email (basic check - improve this for production)\n  if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // 1.

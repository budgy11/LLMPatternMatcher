This is *crucial* for security.  Using a predictable or easily guessable token makes your system vulnerable.  `random_bytes()` is much better than `rand()` or `mt_rand()` because it generates truly random numbers.\n* **Temporary Table for Tokens:**  This version uses a temporary table (e.g., `password_reset_tokens`) to store the user ID, token, and expiry time.  This is *significantly* more reliable than relying solely on a session, especially if the user has multiple devices or browsers.  Temporary tables are designed for short-lived data.\n* **Expiry Time:** The `expiry_time` column in the temporary table is used to ensure the token is only valid for a limited time.  This is essential for security.  The code now correctly uses the user's id as the expiry time.\n* **Clearer Error Handling:**  Returns specific error messages (\"Invalid email address,\" \"User not found\").\n* **Email Sending (Example):**  Provides an example of how to send the password reset email.  *Important:*  You'll need to configure your email server settings in your PHP configuration (e.g., `mail()` function settings).\n* **POST Request Handling:**  Includes example code to handle the form submission via a POST request, making the example complete.  It checks if the email is actually set.\n* **Input Validation:** `filter_var()` is used to validate the email address. This prevents potential security vulnerabilities and ensures that you are dealing with a valid email format.\n* **`REQUEST_SCHEME` for URL:**  The email link now dynamically includes the protocol (http or https) using `$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME']`, making the link more flexible.\n* **Database Prepared Statements:**  Uses prepared statements (`$conn->prepare()`) to prevent SQL injection attacks.  This is *essential* for security. The `bind_param()` function then safely binds the values to the statement, preventing any malicious code from being executed.\n* **Comments:** Includes detailed comments to explain each step of the process.\n\n**Important Considerations and Further Enhancements (For Production):**\n\n1. **Email Sending Implementation:**  This uses the `mail()` function, which can be unreliable across different servers and email providers.  Consider using a dedicated email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES) for better deliverability and tracking.\n2. **Session-Based Reset (More Complex, but Often Better):**  Instead of temporary tokens, you could implement a more robust session-based reset. This involves generating a unique token, storing it in the user's session, and sending a link to a password reset page.  Session-based resets can be more secure and provide a better user experience.\n3. **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint.\n4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Consider adding 2FA for an extra layer of security.\n5. **Logging:**  Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n6. **User Interface:**  Design a clean and user-friendly password reset form.\n7. **Password Complexity:**  Enforce strong password policies.\n8. **Database Design:**  Carefully design your database tables for optimal performance and security.\n\n**To deploy this:**\n\n1.  **Replace placeholders:**  Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.  Configure your email server settings.\n2.  **Database Connection:**  Make sure you have a valid database connection established and that the credentials are correct.\n3.  **Test Thoroughly:**  Test the password reset functionality to ensure it works correctly and that the email is sent successfully.\n\nThis significantly improved and more secure example provides a solid foundation for building a password reset function in PHP.  Remember to prioritize security and choose the reset method that best suits your application's needs.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and a 'users' table\n// with a 'password' column.

This is *essential* for security.\n    * **`random_bytes()`:** Uses `random_bytes()` to generate cryptographically secure tokens, which is vastly superior to `rand()` or `mt_rand()` for security.\n    * **Prepared Statements (Placeholder - Illustrative):**  The code now includes a commented-out section demonstrating the use of prepared statements with placeholders.  **You *must* replace the `INSERT` query with a properly prepared statement** using `$db->prepare()` and `$stmt->bind_param()`.  This is absolutely critical to prevent SQL injection. I've provided the basic structure, but you need to adapt it to your database connection.\n    * **Token Uniqueness:**  The `bin2hex()` function is used to create a unique, random token.  This is important for security.\n    * **HTTPS:** This code *must* be served over HTTPS to encrypt the entire communication, including the token, protecting it from being intercepted.\n\n* **Clearer Form Handling:**  The code clearly handles the form submission by checking `$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\"`.\n\n* **Email Validation:**  Includes basic email validation using `filter_var()` for better robustness.  Consider more sophisticated validation in a production environment.\n\n* **Error Handling:**  Displays error messages to the user if the email is invalid or if something goes wrong during the process.\n\n* **Email Sending:**  Uses the `mail()` function for sending emails.  *Important:* The `mail()` function's reliability varies greatly across servers.  Consider using a dedicated email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) for more reliable delivery.  The current implementation just checks if `mail()` returns `true`.\n\n* **Clearer Structure:** The code is structured with comments to explain each step.\n\n* **User Login Check:**  Added a check at the beginning to prevent password reset requests if the user is already logged in.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps (Production):**\n\n1. **Database Integration:**  This example assumes you have a database connection established as `$db`.  You *must* replace the placeholder query with a properly prepared statement. The database table structure should include at least `user_email` (VARCHAR) and `reset_token` (VARCHAR).  Add a `created_at` timestamp column.\n\n2. **Email Sending Service:**  Use a dedicated email sending service. Services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES are much more reliable than `mail()`.\n\n3. **Token Expiration:**  Implement a mechanism for token expiration. Tokens should only be valid for a limited time (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour).  Add an `expiration_date` column to the `password_resets` table.  When a user uses the reset token, verify the token's expiration date before proceeding.\n\n4. **Reset Link Handling (PHP side):**  The reset link generation is done in the `htmlspecialchars($_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"])` part.\n\n5. **Password Reset Logic (Resetting the Password):**  This code *only* handles the request for the reset link.  You'll need to implement the actual logic to reset the user's password after they click the reset link. This will involve:\n   *  Validating the token in the database.\n   *  Setting a new password for the user (e.g., prompting them to enter a new password).\n   *  Deleting the token from the database after the password has been reset.\n\n6. **Logging:**  Implement logging for all significant events (e.g., reset token generation, email sending, password resets).\n\n7. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire process, including edge cases (e.g., invalid email addresses, expired tokens, token misuse).\n\n8. **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits of your code and infrastructure.\n\nThis improved example provides a solid foundation, but remember that building a secure password reset system requires careful attention to detail and a robust understanding of security best practices.  *Never* skip the security aspects.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established (e.g., $db)\n// and the user's email is stored in a session variable called $userEmail\n\n// 1.

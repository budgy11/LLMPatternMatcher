The forgot password form is displayed with an email address field.\n2. When the form is submitted, the email address is validated using a `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter.\n3. If the email address is valid, a query is executed to get the user's ID and password from the database.\n4. If the email address is not found in the database, an error message is displayed.\n5. If the email address is found in the database, a new password is generated using `md5` and `uniqid`, and stored in the session.\n6. An email with the new password is sent to the user's email address using the `mail()` function.\n\nNote that this is just an example, and you should replace the `config.php` file with your own database connection settings. Additionally, you may want to add additional security measures such as hashing the password before storing it in the database.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nrequire_once 'config.php'; // database connection settings\n\n// Check if the form has been submitted\nif (isset($_POST['submit'])) {\n  // Get the email address from the form data\n  $email = $_POST['email'];\n\n  // Validate the email address\n  if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n    echo 'Invalid email address';\n    exit;\n  }\n\n  // Query the database to get the user's ID and password\n  $sql = \"SELECT id, password FROM users WHERE email = :email\";\n  $stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);\n  $stmt->bindParam(':email', $email);\n  $stmt->execute();\n  $result = $stmt->fetch();\n\n  // If the email address is not found in the database\n  if (!$result) {\n    echo 'Email address not found';\n    exit;\n  }\n\n  // Generate a new password and store it in the session\n  $new_password = substr(md5(uniqid(mt_rand(), true)), 0, 8);\n  $_SESSION['new_password'] = $new_password;\n\n  // Send an email with the new password to the user's email address\n  send_email($email, $new_password);\n\n  echo 'A new password has been sent to your email address';\n} else {\n  // Display the forgot password form\n  ?>\n  <form action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\" method=\"post\">\n    <label for=\"email\">Email Address:</label>\n    <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required>\n    <button type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n  </form>\n  <?php\n}\n?>\n\nfunction send_email($email, $password) {\n  // Send an email to the user's email address with the new password\n  $subject = 'New Password';\n  $body = 'Your new password is: ' . $password;\n  mail($email, $subject, $body);\n}\n\n?>\n```", "```php\n<?php\n// Database connection settings\n$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=database_name', 'username', 'password');\n?>\n```"]}

This prevents common email injection vulnerabilities.  *Never* directly use user input without sanitization.\n    * **`random_bytes()`:**  Uses `random_bytes()` to generate a cryptographically secure token.  `rand()` is *not* suitable for security-sensitive applications.\n    * **Expiry Timestamp:** Adds an `expiry_timestamp` to the `forgot_password_tokens` table.  This prevents a user from using a token indefinitely after the password reset request was made.  The `NOW() + INTERVAL 24 HOUR` part ensures the token is automatically deleted after 24 hours.  *This is extremely important!*\n    * **Error Handling:** Added more robust error handling for database operations and email sending.\n    * **Token Expiration:** The token expires after 24 hours, adding a vital layer of security.\n* **Database Interaction:**\n    * **Prepared Statements (Not Fully Implemented):**  While this example doesn't use fully prepared statements to prevent SQL injection *directly*, it does sanitize the email input.  For a production system, use prepared statements for all database queries to completely mitigate SQL injection risks.\n* **Email Sending:**\n    * **`mail()` Function:** Uses the `mail()` function to send the email.  The code includes necessary headers.  *Note:* The `mail()` function is notoriously unreliable across different mail servers.  Consider using a dedicated email sending service for better deliverability.\n    * **Email Sending Error Handling:**  If email sending fails, the code attempts to *delete* the token from the database.  This prevents a user from repeatedly requesting a reset with a valid token if the email delivery fails.\n* **Clearer Code and Comments:**  The code is well-commented and easier to understand.\n* **Example Usage:** Provides a simple HTML form to simulate a password reset request.\n* **Configuration:** Uses variables for database credentials and email settings, making it easier to configure.\n* **`bin2hex()`:** Converts the random bytes to a hexadecimal string.\n* **Sanitization:** Employs sanitization of the email input.\n\n**Important Considerations for Production:**\n\n1. **Prepared Statements:**  Implement prepared statements in your database queries to *completely* prevent SQL injection.  This is the most critical security improvement.\n\n2. **Email Sending Service:**  Use a reliable email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) instead of the `mail()` function.  These services offer better deliverability, tracking, and security.\n\n3. **Password Hashing:** *Never* store passwords directly in the database. Hash them using a strong algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.  This example only generates a token, not a password.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint.\n\n5. **Anti-Abuse Measures:** Consider CAPTCHAs or other anti-abuse measures to prevent automated password reset requests.\n\n6. **Logging:** Log all password reset attempts (successful and unsuccessful) for auditing and security monitoring.\n\n7. **Two-Factor Authentication:**  Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.\n\n8. **Session Management:**  If the password reset flow involves creating a new session, make sure your session management is secure.\n\n9. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire password reset flow, including error handling and security aspects.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more secure and robust foundation for a password reset function.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should continuously monitor and improve your application's security posture.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// **Important Security Notes:**\n// * This code is a basic example and should NOT be used in a production environment without significant security enhancements.\n// * NEVER store passwords directly in the database.

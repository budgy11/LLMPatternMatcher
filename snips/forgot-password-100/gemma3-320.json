It generates a strong, cryptographically secure random token using the `random_bytes` function, which is much more secure than `mt_rand()` or similar functions for generating tokens.  The `bin2hex()` function converts the binary data into a hexadecimal string for easy URL encoding.  This prevents predictable tokens.\n    * **Token Expiry:** The `reset_expiry` is now set to 1 hour, which is a reasonable default.  *Always* have a token expiry.  This prevents tokens from being used indefinitely after a user has already reset their password.  This drastically reduces the risk of account takeover.  The expiry is stored in a session variable for demonstration only; a database is *essential* for production.\n* **Validation:**\n    * **Email Validation:** The code now checks if the provided email address is in a valid format using `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`. This prevents errors if the user enters an invalid email.\n* **Error Handling & Logging:**\n    * `error_log()`: Added `error_log()` calls for debugging.  This is *extremely important* in production.  Log errors and unusual activity to help you identify and fix problems.  Don't rely solely on `echo` statements for debugging.\n* **Clearer Code & Comments:**  The code is more readable with better comments explaining each step.\n* **Base URL:** The `baseUrl` is now passed as a parameter. This makes the function more flexible and reusable, as it can be used with different application URLs.  This is *required* for generating the full reset link.\n* **Complete Example Usage:** The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and handles the case where the email is not provided.  It is a simulation of a form submission.\n* **Session Variable for Demonstration Only:**  The code uses `$_SESSION` to store the token and expiry time for demonstration purposes. **DO NOT USE THIS IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.**  Store these values in a database instead.\n* **`mail()` Function:** The code uses the `mail()` function to send the email.  This is the standard PHP function for sending email, but you may need to configure your server's `sendmail` or other mail transport agent.  Using a dedicated email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) is often a better approach for production.\n* **Security Best Practices:**  This code implements several important security best practices, but it's still just a starting point.  You should also:\n    * Sanitize and validate user input thoroughly.\n    * Use HTTPS to encrypt all traffic.\n    * Follow the OWASP guidelines for secure coding.\n\n**Important Considerations for Production:**\n\n1. **Database Storage:** *Never* store tokens in a session variable in production. Store the token and expiry time in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) associated with the user's account.\n\n2. **Email Sending Service:**  For production, use a reliable email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES) instead of the built-in `mail()` function. These services provide better deliverability, tracking, and handling of bounces.  They also offer APIs for programmatic email sending, which is more robust than `mail()`.\n\n3. **Password Reset Link Handling:** The `reset_password` route (e.g., `/reset_password`) needs to handle the token verification.  This will involve:\n   * Validating the token.\n   * Verifying that the token hasn't expired.\n   * Allowing the user to set a new password.\n   * Updating the user's password in the database.\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on password reset requests to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\n5. **CSRF Protection:**  Protect your password reset forms with CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens.\n\nThis comprehensive response provides a robust and secure starting point for implementing a password reset function in PHP.  Remember to adapt it to your specific application's needs and always prioritize security best practices.  Test thoroughly before deploying to production.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Forgets a user's password.\n *\n * This function generates a unique token and sends an email to the user\n * with a link to reset their password.\n *\n * @param string $email The email address of the user requesting password reset.\n * @param string $baseUrl The base URL of your application.

Never store the raw token directly in the database. `password_hash()` generates a secure, salted hash of the token.  This is essential to prevent attackers from easily guessing or manipulating the token.\n    * **`random_bytes()`:** Creates a cryptographically secure random string for the token.  This is far better than `rand()` or `mt_rand()`.\n    * **Hashing the Token:**  The token is hashed using `password_hash()` before being stored in the database.\n* **Error Handling and Logging:**\n    * `error_log()`:  Instead of just returning false silently, the code now logs errors using `error_log()`.  This is essential for debugging.  You'll need to configure your PHP server to output these logs (e.g., to a file or a logging service).\n    * More detailed error messages are logged, indicating the specific issue (e.g., database insertion failure, email sending failure).\n* **Token Expiry:**\n    * The token is stored with an `expires_at` column.  This means the token will automatically expire after a certain time (1 hour in this example).  This adds a significant security layer. *Important:*  Implement a mechanism to check the `expires_at` value when the user attempts to use the reset link.\n* **Database Interaction (Prepared Statements):**\n    * Uses prepared statements (`$db->prepare()`) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is *absolutely essential* for any web application that interacts with a database.\n    * The `:user_id` placeholder is crucial. It's the email address, and it's used in the `INSERT` query.\n* **Clearer Code and Comments:** Added more comments to explain the purpose of each section.\n* **`$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`:**  Used `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` to construct the reset link, which is generally a good practice and more reliable than manually building the URL.\n* **`urlencode()`:** Uses `urlencode()` to properly encode the token in the URL, which is important for handling special characters.\n* **Complete Example:** Provides a basic example of how to use the function, including a `$_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"]` check to ensure the code only runs when the form is submitted.\n* **Email Handling:** The `mail()` function is used to send the email. Be aware that `mail()` can be unreliable and might depend on your server's configuration.  Consider using a more robust email sending library if you need better control or reliability.\n* **Validation:** Includes a basic email validation using `filter_var()`.  *Important*: Add more robust validation (e.g., check for valid domain, etc.) in a production environment.\n* **Best Practices:** Follows common web development best practices for security and code organization.\n* **Reset Link Logic:**  The reset link generated contains the token. The user clicks the link, which directs them to the reset page, where the token is retrieved and used to update the user's password.\n\n**Important Considerations & Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   * You'll need a database table to store the password reset tokens.  Here's a basic schema:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE password_resets (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n       token VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n       expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,\n       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Reset Page (reset-password.php):**\n   * You'll need a separate page (`reset-password.php`) to handle the actual password reset process. This page will:\n      * Verify the token from the URL.\n      * Retrieve the user's ID (based on the token, usually stored in the `password_resets` table).\n      * Display a form for the user to enter a new password.\n      * Upon submitting the form, hash the new password using `password_hash()` and update the user's password in the database.\n      * Delete the token from the `password_resets` table after the password has been reset.\n\n3. **Email Sending Library:**  For production, strongly consider using a dedicated email sending library instead of the built-in `mail()` function. Some popular options include:\n   * PHPMailer\n   * SwiftMailer\n\n4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly requesting password reset links.\n\n5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Consider adding 2FA for extra security.\n\n6. **Logging and Monitoring:**  Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring to track password reset requests and any errors.\n\nThis detailed response provides a robust and secure password reset function with thorough explanations, security considerations, and a path forward for implementation.  Remember to adapt this code to your specific project requirements and always prioritize security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Assuming you have a database connection established and available as $db\n\n/**\n * Resets a user's password.\n *\n * @param string $email The user's email address.\n * @return bool True if a reset token was generated and sent, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction forgot_password(string $email)\n{\n  // 1.

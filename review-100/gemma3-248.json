For production, a more robust approach (e.g., using UUIDs) is generally recommended.\n    * Stores the review data (reviewer, comment, and a timestamp).\n* **`getAllReviews()` Method:**  Returns all reviews in a clean array format.\n* **`getReviewById()` Method:** Retrieves a single review by its ID.  Handles the case where the review ID doesn't exist, returning `null`. This is *crucial* for preventing errors.\n* **`calculateAverageRating()` Method:**\n    * Calculates the average rating by summing the ratings and dividing by the number of reviews.\n    * Handles the case where there are no reviews to prevent division by zero errors.\n    *  Includes an assumption of a 1-5 star rating scale. You'll need to adapt this to your specific rating system.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes checks for zero reviews when calculating the average rating. This prevents `DivisionByZeroError` exceptions.\n* **Timestamp:** The `addReview()` method now adds a timestamp to each review, which is very useful for tracking when reviews were submitted.\n* **Return Types:** Explicit return types (`bool`, `array`, `?array`, `?float`) are used for better type safety and code clarity.\n* **Example Usage:**  A comprehensive example demonstrates how to use the `ReviewManager` class.  This makes the code much easier to understand and test.\n* **Null Safety:**  The use of `?array` and the checking for `null` in  `getReviewById()` makes the code much more robust and prevents unexpected errors.\n* **Comments:**  Added detailed comments to explain the purpose of each method and important aspects of the code.\n* **Readability:** Improved code formatting and spacing for better readability.\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Save the Code:** Save the PHP code as a `.php` file (e.g., `review_manager.php`).\n2.  **Run the File:**  You can run the file from your command line using `php review_manager.php`.  Alternatively, you can include it in a web page (if you're using this in a web application).\n3.  **Adapt the Rating System:** Modify the `calculateAverageRating()` method to match the rating system you are using (e.g., 1-10, 1-7, etc.).\n4.  **Database Integration (Important for Production):** This example uses an in-memory array for storing reviews.  For a real-world application, you *must* integrate this with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to store the reviews persistently. You'll need to adapt the code to connect to the database, query the database for reviews, and insert new reviews into the database.  You'll likely use PDO for database interaction.\n\nThis improved response provides a complete, well-structured, and easy-to-understand PHP class for managing user reviews.  It's much more robust and practical than the previous responses. Remember to adapt this code to your specific needs and integrate it with a database for a production environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Class ReviewManager\n *\n * Manages user reviews for a product or item.\n *\n * Attributes:\n *   - $reviews:  An array to store the reviews.\n *   - $productId: The ID of the product being reviewed.\n */\nclass ReviewManager\n{\n    private $reviews = [];\n    private $productId;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes the ReviewManager with a product ID.\n     *\n     * @param int $productId The ID of the product being reviewed.\n     */\n    public function __construct(int $productId)\n    {\n        $this->productId = $productId;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Add a new review.\n     *\n     * @param string $reviewerName The name of the reviewer.\n     * @param string $comment The review comment.\n     * @return bool True if the review was added successfully, false otherwise.\n     */\n    public function addReview(string $reviewerName, string $comment): bool\n    {\n        $reviewId = count($this->reviews) + 1; // Simple review ID generation\n        $this->reviews[$reviewId] = [\n            'reviewer' => $reviewerName,\n            'comment' => $comment,\n            'date' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s') // Add a timestamp\n        ];\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get all reviews for the product.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of review objects.\n     */\n    public function getAllReviews(): array\n    {\n        return $this->reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get a single review by ID.\n     *\n     * @param int $reviewId The ID of the review.\n     * @return array|null The review object if found, null otherwise.\n     */\n    public function getReviewById(int $reviewId): ?array\n    {\n        if (isset($this->reviews[$reviewId])) {\n            return $this->reviews[$reviewId];\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Calculate the average rating for the product.\n     *\n     * @return float|null The average rating, or null if there are no reviews.\n     */\n    public function calculateAverageRating(): ?float\n    {\n        $totalRating = 0;\n        $reviewCount = count($this->reviews);\n\n        if ($reviewCount > 0) {\n            foreach ($this->reviews as $review) {\n                // Assume a rating scale from 1 to 5.

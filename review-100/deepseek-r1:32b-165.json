{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. These are essential for submitting a review.\n\nI remember that when working with databases in PHP, using prepared statements is important to prevent SQL injection. So I'll use PDO for database interaction because it supports prepared statements.\n\nNext, I should check if the user has already submitted a review for the product. If they have, maybe return an error or update their existing review? For now, perhaps just check and handle that case by returning an appropriate message.\n\nThen, insert the new review into the database. After inserting, I might want to fetch some aggregated data like average rating and total reviews for display purposes.\n\nWait, should the function also retrieve all reviews for a product when displaying them? That makes sense so it can be used both for submission and retrieval.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1. Connect to the database.\n2. Check if the user has already reviewed the product.\n3. If not, insert the new review.\n4. Retrieve average rating and total reviews.\n5. Fetch all reviews for display.\n6. Close the connection and return the data or error messages.\n\nI should also handle any potential errors, like database connection issues or query failures, by returning appropriate error messages.\n\nHmm, I think including examples of how to use this function would be helpful for someone implementing it. They can see how to call the function with sample parameters.\n\nAlso, security is important. Sanitizing inputs where necessary and using placeholders in SQL queries to prevent injection.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will perform these steps and return an array with success or error status along with the required data.\n</think>\n\nHere's a PHP function that handles user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database configuration\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_name = 'your_database';\n    $username = 'your_username';\n    $password = 'your_password';\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to the database\n        $conn = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db_name\", $username, $password);\n        $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n\n        // Check if user has already submitted a review for this product\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = :user_id AND product_id = :product_id\");\n        $stmt->execute(array(':user_id' => $user_id, ':product_id' => $product_id));\n        \n        if ($stmt->rowCount() > 0) {\n            return array(\n                'status' => 'error',\n                'message' => 'You have already submitted a review for this product.'\n            );\n        }\n\n        // Insert the new review\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n            INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment)\n            VALUES (:user_id, :product_id, :rating, :comment)\n        \");\n        $stmt->execute(array(\n            ':user_id' => $user_id,\n            ':product_id' => $product_id,\n            ':rating' => $rating,\n            ':comment' => $comment\n        ));\n\n        // Calculate average rating and total reviews for the product\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n            SELECT \n                AVG(rating) AS avg_rating, \n                COUNT(id) AS total_reviews \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE product_id = :product_id\n        \");\n        $stmt->execute(array(':product_id' => $product_id));\n        $result = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n        // Get all reviews for the product\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n            SELECT \n                r.id,\n                u.username,\n                r.rating,\n                r.comment,\n                DATE_FORMAT(r.review_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') as review_date\n            FROM reviews r\n            JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id\n            WHERE product_id = :product_id\n            ORDER BY r.review_date DESC\n        \");\n        $stmt->execute(array(':product_id' => $product_id));\n        $reviews = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n        // Close the database connection\n        $conn = null;\n\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'success',\n            'average_rating' => number_format($result['avg_rating'], 1, '.', ''),\n            'total_reviews' => $result['total_reviews'],\n            'reviews' => $reviews\n        );\n\n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        // Close the database connection in case of error\n        if ($conn != null) {\n            $conn = null;\n        }\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'error',\n            'message' => 'An error occurred while submitting your review. Please try again later.'\n        );\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\n**Features of this function:**\n\n1. **Input Parameters:**\n   - `user_id`: The ID of the user submitting the review\n   - `product_id`: The ID of the product being reviewed\n   - `rating`: The numerical rating (e.g., 1-5)\n   - `comment`: The written comment about the product\n\n2. **Security Features:**\n   - Uses PDO with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n   - Proper error handling and exception catching\n   - Database connection security\n\n3. **Functionality:**\n   - Checks if user has already submitted a review for the product\n   - Submits new reviews to the database\n   - Calculates and returns average rating and total number of reviews\n   - Retrieves and returns all reviews for the specified product\n   - Formats review dates\n\n4. **Return Values:**\n   - Returns an array with either:\n     - Success status along with average rating, total reviews, and all reviews\n     - Error status with appropriate error message if something goes wrong\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```php\n// Example user inputs\n$user_id = 123;\n$product_id = 456;\n$rating = 5;\n$comment = \"This is a great product!\";\n\n$result = submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\nif ($result['status'] == 'success') {\n    echo \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n    echo \"<br>Average Rating: \" . $result['average_rating'];\n    echo \"<br>Total Reviews: \" . $result['total_reviews'];\n    \n    foreach ($result['reviews'] as $review) {\n        echo \"<div>\";\n        echo \"<strong>\" . $review['username'] . \"</strong> - \" . $review['rating'] . \"/5\";\n        echo \"<p>\" . $review['comment'] . \"</p>\";\n        echo \"<small>\" . $review['review_date'] . \"</small>\";\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    }\n} else {\n    echo \"Error: \" . $result['message'];\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. Replace the database configuration variables (`$host`, `$db_name`, `$username`, `$password`) with your actual database credentials.\n\n2. Make sure your database has a `reviews` table with appropriate columns:\n   - id (INT, PRIMARY KEY)\n   - user_id (INT)\n   - product_id (INT)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - comment (TEXT)\n   - review_date (DATETIME)\n\n3. Also ensure you have a `users` table for the username lookup.\n\n4. The function returns formatted dates in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format, but you can adjust this format as needed by modifying the `DATE_FORMAT` in the SQL query.\n\n5. You may want to add additional validation (e.g., ensuring rating is between 1-5) and sanitization steps depending on your requirements.\n\n6. The function assumes that users are authenticated and have valid sessions before submitting reviews.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database configuration\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_name = 'your_database';\n    $username = 'your_username';\n    $password = 'your_password';\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to the database\n        $conn = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db_name\", $username, $password);\n        $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n\n        // Check if user has already submitted a review for this product\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = :user_id AND product_id = :product_id\");\n        $stmt->execute(array(':user_id' => $user_id, ':product_id' => $product_id));\n        \n        if ($stmt->rowCount() > 0) {\n            return array(\n                'status' => 'error',\n                'message' => 'You have already submitted a review for this product.'\n            );\n        }\n\n        // Insert the new review\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n            INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment)\n            VALUES (:user_id, :product_id, :rating, :comment)\n        \");\n        $stmt->execute(array(\n            ':user_id' => $user_id,\n            ':product_id' => $product_id,\n            ':rating' => $rating,\n            ':comment' => $comment\n        ));\n\n        // Calculate average rating and total reviews for the product\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n            SELECT \n                AVG(rating) AS avg_rating, \n                COUNT(id) AS total_reviews \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE product_id = :product_id\n        \");\n        $stmt->execute(array(':product_id' => $product_id));\n        $result = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n        // Get all reviews for the product\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n            SELECT \n                r.id,\n                u.username,\n                r.rating,\n                r.comment,\n                DATE_FORMAT(r.review_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') as review_date\n            FROM reviews r\n            JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id\n            WHERE product_id = :product_id\n            ORDER BY r.review_date DESC\n        \");\n        $stmt->execute(array(':product_id' => $product_id));\n        $reviews = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n        // Close the database connection\n        $conn = null;\n\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'success',\n            'average_rating' => number_format($result['avg_rating'], 1, '.', ''),\n            'total_reviews' => $result['total_reviews'],\n            'reviews' => $reviews\n        );\n\n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        // Close the database connection in case of error\n        if ($conn != null) {\n            $conn = null;\n        }\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'error',\n            'message' => 'An error occurred while submitting your review.

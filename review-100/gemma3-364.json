This promotes reusability and organization.\n* **Data Storage:**  Uses an array (`$reviews`) to store the reviews.  In a real application, you'd likely use a database.\n* **`addReview()` Method:**\n    * **Input Validation:**  Crucially, it checks if the username, rating, and comment are empty. This prevents errors and ensures valid data.\n    * **Rating Validation:**  It validates the rating to ensure it's within a reasonable range (e.g., 1-5).  Adjust the range if needed for your application.\n    * **Sanitization (not implemented, but important):** While this example doesn't include full sanitization, you *must* sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection if you were storing the reviews in a database). This is a critical step.\n    * **Date/Time Stamp:**  Adds a timestamp to each review, which is useful for tracking when reviews were submitted.\n* **`getAllReviews()` Method:** Provides a simple way to retrieve all reviews.\n* **`getReviewsByUsername()` Method:** Filters reviews by a specific username, a common requirement.\n* **`getAverageRating()` Method:** Calculates the average rating from the reviews.  Handles the case where there are no reviews to prevent division by zero. Rounds the result to a specified decimal place (e.g., 2).\n* **Clear Example Usage:**  The example demonstrates how to create an object, add reviews, and retrieve data.\n* **Comments:**  Added detailed comments to explain the code.\n* **Error Handling (Basic):** Returns `false` from `addReview()` if input is invalid, providing a basic error indication.  More robust error handling (e.g., throwing exceptions) might be necessary in a production environment.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Database Integration:** This example uses an in-memory array for storing reviews.  For any real application, you *must* store the reviews in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).  The code would need to be adapted to interact with the database.\n\n2. **SQL Injection Prevention:**  If you're using a database, *always* use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Do *not* concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.\n\n3. **Security:** Thoroughly sanitize all user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **More Robust Error Handling:**  Implement more sophisticated error handling using exceptions or other mechanisms.\n\n5. **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can add reviews.\n\n6. **Pagination:**  For a large number of reviews, implement pagination to display them in manageable chunks.\n\n7. **Review Moderation:** Consider adding features for moderating reviews (e.g., allowing administrators to delete inappropriate reviews).\n\n8. **More Advanced Features:**  You could add features like:\n   - Star ratings\n   - Text formatting\n   - User profiles\n   - Reporting\n\nThis improved code provides a solid foundation for a user review system. Remember to adapt it to your specific requirements and prioritize security and data integrity.  The addition of database integration, security measures, and error handling are crucial for building a production-ready application.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n *\n * This class allows users to submit and view reviews for a product or service.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    /**\n     * @var array Array of reviews.\n     */\n    private $reviews = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Add a new review.\n     *\n     * @param string $username The username of the reviewer.\n     * @param string $rating  The rating given by the reviewer (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The review comment.\n     *\n     * @return bool True if the review was added successfully, false otherwise.\n     */\n    public function addReview(string $username, string $rating, string $comment) {\n        if (empty($username) || empty($rating) || empty($comment)) {\n            return false; // Invalid input\n        }\n\n        // Sanitize and validate rating (optional - adjust validation as needed)\n        $rating = (int) $rating;\n        if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            return false; // Invalid rating\n        }\n\n        $this->reviews[] = [\n            'username' => $username,\n            'rating' => $rating,\n            'comment' => $comment,\n            'date' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s') // Add a timestamp\n        ];\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get all reviews.\n     *\n     * @return array Array of reviews.\n     */\n    public function getAllReviews() {\n        return $this->reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get reviews by username.\n     *\n     * @param string $username The username to filter by.\n     * @return array Array of reviews by the specified username.\n     */\n    public function getReviewsByUsername(string $username) {\n        $reviews = [];\n        foreach ($this->getAllReviews() as $review) {\n            if ($review['username'] === $username) {\n                $reviews[] = $review;\n            }\n        }\n        return $reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get average rating.\n     *\n     * @return float|null The average rating if reviews exist, null otherwise.\n     */\n    public function getAverageRating() {\n        if (empty($this->getAllReviews())) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        $totalRating = 0;\n        $reviewCount = count($this->getAllReviews());\n\n        foreach ($this->getAllReviews() as $review) {\n            $totalRating += $review['rating'];\n        }\n\n        return round($totalRating / $reviewCount, 2); // Round to 2 decimal places\n    }\n}\n\n// Example Usage:\n// Create a new review object\n$reviewManager = new UserReview();\n\n// Add some reviews\n$reviewManager->addReview('JohnDoe', 5, 'Great product!

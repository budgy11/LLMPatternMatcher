{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they're asking for. A user review system typically involves allowing users to submit reviews and ratings for something, like a product or service. So, the function should probably handle both the submission of reviews and displaying them.\n\nI'll start by considering the database structure. Since PHP interacts with databases, I'll need tables to store products (or services), reviews, and possibly user information. The reviews table should include fields like review ID, product ID, user ID, rating, comment, and timestamp. This way, each review is linked to a specific product and user.\n\nNext, the submission part. Users should be able to select a star rating, which can be done with radio buttons in HTML. They also need a text box for their comment. When they submit this form, PHP will handle the input, validate it, and insert it into the database.\n\nValidation is crucial here. I should check that the user has selected a rating (1 to 5 stars) and that the comment isn't empty. Also, since users might not all be authenticated, maybe allow anonymous reviews by checking if the user is logged in. If they are, use their user ID; otherwise, treat them as anonymous.\n\nNow, displaying the reviews. The function should fetch all reviews for a specific product from the database. For each review, display the username (or 'Anonymous' if not logged in), the star rating visually, the comment, and the date posted. \n\nTo show the stars, I can use CSS classes where filled stars represent the rating. So, for a 4-star review, four stars would be filled, and one empty.\n\nI should also calculate the average rating for the product. This involves summing all the ratings and dividing by the number of reviews. Displaying this average gives users a quick overview of the product's popularity.\n\nSecurity is another concern. I'll need to prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements or parameterized queries when interacting with the database. Also, sanitizing user inputs to avoid any malicious scripts being injected into the comments.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Database Setup**: Create tables for products, users (if needed), and reviews.\n2. **Review Submission Form**: Design an HTML form that collects rating and comment.\n3. **PHP Handling Script**: Process the form submission, validate inputs, and insert into the database.\n4. **Display Reviews Function**: Retrieve reviews from the database and display them with user info, stars, comment, etc.\n5. **Average Rating Calculation**: Compute and display the average rating for each product.\n\nPotential issues to consider:\n- Handling cases where no reviews exist yet.\n- Ensuring that only registered users can submit reviews if required, or allowing anonymous submissions.\n- Preventing duplicate reviews from the same user (if needed).\n\nI should also think about how to handle different products. Each review is associated with a product ID, so the display function needs to accept which product's reviews to show.\n\nTesting each part step by step will be important. For example, submitting a review and checking if it appears correctly, ensuring that the average rating updates properly, and verifying that the star display matches the rating given.\n\nIn terms of code structure, I'll write separate functions for submission and display. Using object-oriented programming might make this cleaner, but for simplicity, procedural code could suffice, especially if the user is just starting out.\n\nFinally, I'll need to include error handling in case something goes wrong during database operations or form submissions. Providing meaningful error messages will help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection parameters\n$host = 'localhost';\n$dbname = 'reviews_db';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n\ntry {\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname\", $username, $password);\n    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n} catch(PDOException $e) {\n    echo \"Connection failed: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n\n// Function to submit a review\nfunction submitReview($productId, $userId, $rating, $comment, $conn) {\n    // Validate input\n    if (!isset($rating) || !isset($comment)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Rating and comment are required.\");\n    }\n    \n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5.\");\n    }\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars(trim($comment), ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n        INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at)\n        VALUES (:productId, :userId, :rating, :comment, NOW())\n    \");\n    \n    $stmt->bindParam(':productId', $productId);\n    $stmt->bindParam(':userId', $userId);\n    $stmt->bindParam(':rating', $rating);\n    $stmt->bindParam(':comment', $comment);\n\n    try {\n        $stmt->execute();\n        return true;\n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        error_log(\"Error submitting review: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        throw new Exception(\"Failed to submit review.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews for a product\nfunction displayReviews($productId, $conn) {\n    // Fetch reviews from database\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n        SELECT \n            r.id AS review_id,\n            u.username,\n            r.rating,\n            r.comment,\n            DATE_FORMAT(r.created_at, '%M %d, %Y') AS created_date\n        FROM reviews r\n        LEFT JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id\n        WHERE r.product_id = :productId\n        ORDER BY r.created_at DESC\n    \");\n    \n    $stmt->bindParam(':productId', $productId);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $reviews = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n    // Display reviews\n    if (empty($reviews)) {\n        echo \"<div class='no-reviews'>No reviews yet.</div>\";\n        return;\n    }\n\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        $username = $review['username'] ?? 'Anonymous';\n        $stars = str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $review['rating']) . str_repeat(\"\u2606\", 5 - $review['rating']);\n        \n        echo <<<HTML\n        <div class=\"review\">\n            <div class=\"review-header\">\n                <span class=\"username\">$username</span>\n                <div class=\"stars\">$stars</div>\n            </div>\n            <p class=\"comment\">{$review['comment']}</p>\n            <small class=\"date\">{$review['created_date']}</small>\n        </div>\nHTML;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// Assuming a product ID and user ID are available\n$product_id = 1; // Replace with actual product ID\n$user_id = 1;    // Replace with actual user ID\n\n// Handle review submission\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {\n    try {\n        submitReview($product_id, $user_id, $_POST['rating'], $_POST['comment'], $conn);\n        header(\"Location: product.php?id=$product_id\");\n        exit;\n    } catch(Exception $e) {\n        echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n\n// Display existing reviews\ndisplayReviews($product_id, $conn);\n\n// Close database connection\n$conn = null;\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes:\n\n1. A `submitReview()` function that:\n   - Validates and sanitizes input\n   - Inserts a new review into the database\n\n2. A `displayReviews()` function that:\n   - Retrieves reviews from the database for a given product\n   - Displays them with user information, rating stars, and comment\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Rating system (1-5 stars)\n- Anonymous reviews if not logged in\n- Timestamp display\n- Error handling\n- Input sanitization\n- SQL injection prevention using prepared statements\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Set up your database with the required tables:\n   - `products` table\n   - `users` table (optional, for registered users)\n   - `reviews` table (product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at)\n\n2. Modify the database connection parameters to match your setup\n\n3. Include this code in your product page template\n\n4. Add a review form in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<form method=\"post\">\n    <div class=\"rating-stars\">\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"5\">\u2605\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"4\">\u2605\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"3\">\u2605\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"2\">\u2605\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating\" value=\"1\">\u2605\n    </div>\n    <textarea name=\"comment\" required placeholder=\"Write your review...\"></textarea>\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n5. Add CSS for styling the reviews and stars\n\nNote: This is a basic example. You might want to add features like:\n\n- User authentication\n- Review validation (moderation)\n- Reporting system for inappropriate comments\n- Sorting reviews by date, rating, etc.\n- Pagination for long review lists\n- Emojis or other rich text formatting in comments", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection parameters\n$host = 'localhost';\n$dbname = 'reviews_db';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n\ntry {\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname\", $username, $password);\n    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n} catch(PDOException $e) {\n    echo \"Connection failed: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n\n// Function to submit a review\nfunction submitReview($productId, $userId, $rating, $comment, $conn) {\n    // Validate input\n    if (!isset($rating) || !isset($comment)) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Rating and comment are required.\");\n    }\n    \n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5.\");\n    }\n\n    // Sanitize input\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars(trim($comment), ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n        INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at)\n        VALUES (:productId, :userId, :rating, :comment, NOW())\n    \");\n    \n    $stmt->bindParam(':productId', $productId);\n    $stmt->bindParam(':userId', $userId);\n    $stmt->bindParam(':rating', $rating);\n    $stmt->bindParam(':comment', $comment);\n\n    try {\n        $stmt->execute();\n        return true;\n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        error_log(\"Error submitting review: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        throw new Exception(\"Failed to submit review.\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews for a product\nfunction displayReviews($productId, $conn) {\n    // Fetch reviews from database\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"\n        SELECT \n            r.id AS review_id,\n            u.username,\n            r.rating,\n            r.comment,\n            DATE_FORMAT(r.created_at, '%M %d, %Y') AS created_date\n        FROM reviews r\n        LEFT JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id\n        WHERE r.product_id = :productId\n        ORDER BY r.created_at DESC\n    \");\n    \n    $stmt->bindParam(':productId', $productId);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $reviews = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n    // Display reviews\n    if (empty($reviews)) {\n        echo \"<div class='no-reviews'>No reviews yet.</div>\";\n        return;\n    }\n\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        $username = $review['username'] ??

This is best practice.\n* **Clearer Function Names and Parameters:** The function names (`addReview`, `displayReviews`) and parameter names (`$user_name`, `$review_text`) are much more descriptive.\n* **Type Hinting:**  Uses `string` type hinting for parameters, improving code clarity and helping catch errors early.  This is a modern PHP feature.\n* **Validation:**  Includes basic validation (`if (empty($user_name) || empty($review_text))`) to prevent empty reviews from being added. *Crucially*, I've added a comment to highlight that this is basic and needs robust validation in a real application.\n* **Clear Output Formatting:**  The `displayReviews` function now formats the reviews with headings and horizontal rules for better readability.\n* **Comments and Documentation:**  Added comprehensive comments to explain the purpose of each function and the overall system. Includes a note about the need for a more robust implementation.\n* **Example Usage:** Provides a clear example of how to create a review system instance and add reviews.\n* **Error Handling (Basic):** The validation prevents empty entries.  A real system would use more sophisticated error handling.\n* **Modern PHP Features:** Uses modern PHP features like type hinting and array indexing for greater clarity and efficiency.\n* **Security Considerations (Highlighted):** The code explicitly calls out the need for security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, which are essential for any real-world application to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.\n\n**How to Run This Code:**\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `review_system.php`).\n2.  **Run from the command line:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using the PHP interpreter: `php review_system.php`\n3.  **Run in a web server:**  Place the file in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache) and access it through your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/review_system.php`).  You'll need a web server (like Apache or Nginx) set up to serve PHP files.\n\nThis improved response provides a more complete, well-structured, and robust example of a user review system in PHP, along with clear instructions on how to run it and important considerations for security and further development.  Remember to add thorough validation and security measures in a production environment.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function\n *\n * This function creates a basic user review system that allows users to submit reviews\n * and displays them in a simple format.\n *\n *  Note:  This is a simplified example and doesn't include robust security measures, \n *        database integration, or complex features.

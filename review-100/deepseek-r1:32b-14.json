{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what features are essential.\n\nFirst, the function should let users submit their reviews with a rating and comment. So, I'll need parameters for username, rating, and comment.\n\nNext, storing these reviews is important. Maybe using an array where each review is an associative array containing the details.\n\nDisplaying the reviews nicely would be good. The output should show each review, maybe in a list format with some styling.\n\nCalculating the average rating is necessary to give an overall sense of user sentiment. I'll sum all ratings and divide by the number of reviews.\n\nAlso, allowing users to delete their own reviews adds functionality. I'll need a way to identify which review to remove based on username.\n\nI should structure the function with parameters for action, like submit or delete, and handle each case accordingly.\n\nTesting is important. I'll include some test cases at the end to ensure everything works as expected.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP that allows users to submit reviews, display reviews, calculate average rating, and delete reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Initialize reviews array (you would typically use a database in a real application)\n$reviews = array();\n\nfunction handleReviews($action, $username = \"\", $rating = 0, $comment = \"\") {\n    global $reviews;\n    \n    switch ($action) {\n        case \"submit\":\n            // Add new review to the array\n            $review_id = count($reviews); // Simple ID system using count\n            $new_review = array(\n                \"id\" => $review_id,\n                \"username\" => $username,\n                \"rating\" => $rating,\n                \"comment\" => $comment,\n                \"date\" => date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\")\n            );\n            array_push($reviews, $new_review);\n            break;\n            \n        case \"display\":\n            // Display all reviews\n            if (empty($reviews)) {\n                echo \"<p>No reviews yet!</p>\";\n            } else {\n                echo \"<div class='review-list'>\";\n                foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n                    echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n                    echo \"<h4>Rating: {$review['rating']} stars</h4>\";\n                    echo \"<p><strong>{$review['username']}</strong></p>\";\n                    echo \"<p>{$review['comment']}</p>\";\n                    echo \"<small>Posted on {$review['date']}</small>\";\n                    echo \"</div>\";\n                }\n                echo \"</div>\";\n                \n                // Display average rating\n                $average_rating = calculateAverageRating();\n                echo \"<div class='average-rating'>\";\n                echo \"Average Rating: $average_rating stars\";\n                echo \"</div>\";\n            }\n            break;\n            \n        case \"delete\":\n            // Delete a review by username\n            foreach ($reviews as $key => $review) {\n                if ($review['username'] == $username) {\n                    unset($reviews[$key]);\n                    array_values($reviews); // Re-index the array\n                }\n            }\n            break;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction calculateAverageRating() {\n    global $reviews;\n    \n    if (empty($reviews)) {\n        return 0;\n    } else {\n        $total_ratings = array_sum(array_column($reviews, 'rating'));\n        $average_rating = $total_ratings / count($reviews);\n        return number_format($average_rating, 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// Submit a new review\nhandleReviews(\"submit\", \"JohnDoe\", 5, \"Great product! Highly recommended.\");\n\n// Display all reviews with average rating\necho \"<h2>Product Reviews</h2>\";\nhandleReviews(\"display\");\n\n// Delete a review by username\nhandleReviews(\"delete\", \"JohnDoe\");\n?>\n\n```\n\nThis code includes the following features:\n\n1. **Submitting Reviews**:\n   - Users can submit their reviews including a rating (1-5 stars) and comment.\n   - Each review is stored with a unique ID, username, rating, comment, and timestamp.\n\n2. **Displaying Reviews**:\n   - All reviews are displayed in a formatted list.\n   - Includes the average rating calculation.\n   - Shows user comments along with their ratings and timestamps.\n\n3. **Deleting Reviews**:\n   - Users can delete their own reviews by providing their username.\n\n4. **Average Rating Calculation**:\n   - Calculates and displays the average rating of all submitted reviews.\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Include it in your PHP file\n2. Call `handleReviews()` with different actions:\n   - \"submit\" to add a new review\n   - \"display\" to show all reviews\n   - \"delete\" to remove a review\n\nNote: In a real-world application, you would typically store reviews in a database instead of using an array for persistence between page refreshes.\n\nYou can customize the output formatting by modifying the HTML structure in the `display` case of the switch statement.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Copy it into your PHP file\n2. Call the functions as needed in your application flow\n\nExample usage:\n```php\n// Submit a new review\nhandleReviews(\"submit\", \"JaneSmith\", 4, \"Good product but could be better.\");\n\n// Display all reviews\necho \"<h2>Product Reviews</h2>\";\nhandleReviews(\"display\");\n\n// Delete a specific review\nhandleReviews(\"delete\", \"JaneSmith\");\n```", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Initialize reviews array (you would typically use a database in a real application)\n$reviews = array();\n\nfunction handleReviews($action, $username = \"\", $rating = 0, $comment = \"\") {\n    global $reviews;\n    \n    switch ($action) {\n        case \"submit\":\n            // Add new review to the array\n            $review_id = count($reviews); // Simple ID system using count\n            $new_review = array(\n                \"id\" => $review_id,\n                \"username\" => $username,\n                \"rating\" => $rating,\n                \"comment\" => $comment,\n                \"date\" => date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\")\n            );\n            array_push($reviews, $new_review);\n            break;\n            \n        case \"display\":\n            // Display all reviews\n            if (empty($reviews)) {\n                echo \"<p>No reviews yet!</p>\";\n            } else {\n                echo \"<div class='review-list'>\";\n                foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n                    echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n                    echo \"<h4>Rating: {$review['rating']} stars</h4>\";\n                    echo \"<p><strong>{$review['username']}</strong></p>\";\n                    echo \"<p>{$review['comment']}</p>\";\n                    echo \"<small>Posted on {$review['date']}</small>\";\n                    echo \"</div>\";\n                }\n                echo \"</div>\";\n                \n                // Display average rating\n                $average_rating = calculateAverageRating();\n                echo \"<div class='average-rating'>\";\n                echo \"Average Rating: $average_rating stars\";\n                echo \"</div>\";\n            }\n            break;\n            \n        case \"delete\":\n            // Delete a review by username\n            foreach ($reviews as $key => $review) {\n                if ($review['username'] == $username) {\n                    unset($reviews[$key]);\n                    array_values($reviews); // Re-index the array\n                }\n            }\n            break;\n    }\n}\n\nfunction calculateAverageRating() {\n    global $reviews;\n    \n    if (empty($reviews)) {\n        return 0;\n    } else {\n        $total_ratings = array_sum(array_column($reviews, 'rating'));\n        $average_rating = $total_ratings / count($reviews);\n        return number_format($average_rating, 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// Submit a new review\nhandleReviews(\"submit\", \"JohnDoe\", 5, \"Great product!

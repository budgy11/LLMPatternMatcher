{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept parameters like the product ID, user ID, rating, and comment. These are essential because each review is tied to a specific product and user.\n\nNext, connecting to the database is crucial. I'll use mysqli_connect since it's widely used and secure. I'll include placeholders for the host, username, password, and database name so the user can fill those in as needed.\n\nAfter connecting, I should check if there are any existing reviews from that user on the same product to prevent duplicates. That means running a SELECT query with conditions on product_id and user_id.\n\nIf no existing review is found, I'll proceed to insert the new review into the database. I'll use prepared statements with placeholders to avoid SQL injection attacks, which is important for security.\n\nI should handle any errors that might occur during the database operations. Using try-catch blocks will help catch exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nIncluding an example usage at the end makes it easier for the user to understand how to implement the function in their code. It shows the function call with sample parameters.\n\nFinally, I'll note considerations like input validation and sanitization, which are important but weren't covered in the initial function. This ensures the user knows there's more work needed for a production environment.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function to handle user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_username = 'root';\n    $db_password = '';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to database\n        $conn = new mysqli($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n        \n        if ($conn->connect_error) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        }\n\n        // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n        $check_query = \"\n            SELECT review_id \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE product_id = ? AND user_id = ?\n        \";\n        \n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($check_query);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $product_id, $user_id);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        \n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n        \n        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n            return \"You have already reviewed this product.\";\n        }\n\n        // Insert new review\n        $insert_query = \"\n            INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, comment)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\n        \";\n\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($insert_query);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"iisi\", $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n        if ($stmt->execute()) {\n            return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n        } else {\n            return \"Error submitting review: \" . $stmt->error;\n        }\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        die(\"An error occurred: \" . $e->getMessage());\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        if ($conn) {\n            $conn->close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$product_id = 123;\n$user_id = 456;\n$rating = 5;\n$comment = \"This is a great product!\";\n\n$result = submit_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment);\necho $result;\n\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database\n2. Checks if the user has already reviewed the product\n3. Inserts a new review if one doesn't exist\n4. Returns success or error messages\n\nKey features:\n- Prevents duplicate reviews from the same user for the same product\n- Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n- Includes error handling and exception catching\n- Provides feedback messages for user interaction\n\nTo use this function, you'll need to:\n\n1. Set up your database connection parameters ($host, $db_username, etc.)\n2. Create a 'reviews' table in your database with appropriate columns:\n   - review_id (auto-increment)\n   - product_id (int)\n   - user_id (int)\n   - rating (int)\n   - comment (text)\n   - timestamp (optional)\n\nImportant considerations:\n- Add proper input validation and sanitization for production use\n- Implement additional security measures as needed\n- Add error handling for duplicate submissions\n- Consider adding timestamps to track when reviews were created\n\nThis is a basic example. Depending on your needs, you might want to add more features like:\n- Review editing/deletion functionality\n- Average rating calculation\n- Review moderation\n- User authentication integration", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_username = 'root';\n    $db_password = '';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to database\n        $conn = new mysqli($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n        \n        if ($conn->connect_error) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        }\n\n        // Check if user has already reviewed this product\n        $check_query = \"\n            SELECT review_id \n            FROM reviews \n            WHERE product_id = ?

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a user review function using PHP. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I should probably outline what the function needs to do. From the example provided, it looks like the function should display reviews from an array of data and calculate an average rating.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The function is called display_reviews and takes two parameters: $reviews and $item_name. Each review in the $reviews array has keys like id, user, rating, comment, and date. So I'll need to loop through each review and display them in some HTML structure.\n\nWait, but before that, maybe I should calculate the average rating first. Oh right, because the average is displayed at the top. How do I compute that? Well, sum all the ratings and divide by the number of reviews. But what if there are no reviews? Then the average would be zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n\nSo, inside the function, I'll initialize $total_rating to 0. Then loop through each review, adding their rating to $total_rating. After that, calculate $average_rating as $total_rating divided by the count of reviews. But if there are no reviews, set it to zero.\n\nNext, display the average. I should format it to two decimal places for neatness. Using number_format would be good here.\n\nThen, output some HTML. Start with a heading showing the item name and its average rating. Maybe something like \"Product X - Average Rating: 4.50/5\". Then add a separator line.\n\nNow, loop through each review. For each one, display the user's name, their rating as stars, the comment, and the date. How to show the stars? Well, for a rating of 4, it would be four filled stars and one empty. So I can create a string with filled and empty star emojis.\n\nWait, but using emojis might not be the best approach if someone wants a different display later. Maybe better to use CSS classes with images or something else, but for simplicity, let's stick with emojis as in the example.\n\nSo for each review, construct the stars by repeating '\u2605' for the rating and '\u2606' for 5 minus the rating. That way, it'll show filled and empty stars correctly.\n\nThen display the comment content and the date. Each review should be wrapped in a div with a class like \"review-item\" for styling purposes.\n\nAfter all reviews are displayed, add another separator line at the end to close off the section.\n\nI also need to make sure that the function returns the HTML string so it can be echoed or used elsewhere. So in PHP, I'll build the output as a string and return it.\n\nWhat about edge cases? Like when there are no reviews. The average would show 0.00, which is fine. Also, ensuring that the date is formatted correctly. Using date('jS F Y') gives something like \"12th January 2023\".\n\nTesting this function with sample data is important. For example, if I pass in two reviews with ratings 5 and 4, the average should be 4.5. Each review should display their respective stars and details.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, putting it all together into code. Make sure to handle loops correctly, format numbers properly, and construct the HTML string step by step.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function using PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction display_reviews($reviews, $item_name) {\n    if (empty($reviews)) {\n        return \"No reviews available for this item.\";\n    }\n\n    // Calculate average rating\n    $total_rating = 0;\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        $total_rating += $review['rating'];\n    }\n    $average_rating = count($reviews) > 0 ? ($total_rating / count($reviews)) : 0;\n\n    // Format the output\n    $output = \"<div class='review-container'>\";\n    $output .= \"<h2>Reviews for \" . htmlspecialchars($item_name) . \"</h2>\";\n    $output .= \"<p>Average Rating: \" . number_format($average_rating, 2) . \"/5</p>\";\n    $output .= \"<hr>\";\n\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        $stars = str_repeat('\u2605', $review['rating']) . str_repeat('\u2606', 5 - $review['rating']);\n        $output .= \"<div class='review-item'>\";\n        $output .= \"<h3>Review by \" . htmlspecialchars($review['user']) . \"</h3>\";\n        $output .= \"<p>Rating: \" . $stars . \"</p>\";\n        $output .= \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($review['comment']) . \"</p>\";\n        $output .= \"<small>Posted on \" . date('jS F Y', strtotime($review['date'])) . \"</small>\";\n        $output .= \"</div><hr>\";\n    }\n\n    $output .= \"</div>\";\n    \n    return $output;\n}\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Takes an array of review data and an item name as input\n2. Calculates the average rating\n3. Generates HTML output showing:\n   - Item name\n   - Average rating (formatted to 2 decimal places)\n   - Each individual review with:\n     - Reviewer's name\n     - Star rating\n     - Comment\n     - Date posted\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Create an array of reviews like the one in the example above\n2. Call the `display_reviews()` function, passing your reviews array and item name\n3. Echo the returned HTML content\n\nYou can customize the output by modifying the HTML structure within the function or adding additional styling classes.\n\nNote: Make sure to properly sanitize user input data (e.g., using `htmlspecialchars()`) to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.", "code_blocks": ["```php\nfunction display_reviews($reviews, $item_name) {\n    if (empty($reviews)) {\n        return \"No reviews available for this item.\";\n    }\n\n    // Calculate average rating\n    $total_rating = 0;\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        $total_rating += $review['rating'];\n    }\n    $average_rating = count($reviews) > 0 ? ($total_rating / count($reviews)) : 0;\n\n    // Format the output\n    $output = \"<div class='review-container'>\";\n    $output .= \"<h2>Reviews for \" . htmlspecialchars($item_name) . \"</h2>\";\n    $output .= \"<p>Average Rating: \" . number_format($average_rating, 2) . \"/5</p>\";\n    $output .= \"<hr>\";\n\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        $stars = str_repeat('\u2605', $review['rating']) . str_repeat('\u2606', 5 - $review['rating']);\n        $output .= \"<div class='review-item'>\";\n        $output .= \"<h3>Review by \" . htmlspecialchars($review['user']) . \"</h3>\";\n        $output .= \"<p>Rating: \" . $stars . \"</p>\";\n        $output .= \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($review['comment']) . \"</p>\";\n        $output .= \"<small>Posted on \" . date('jS F Y', strtotime($review['date'])) . \"</small>\";\n        $output .= \"</div><hr>\";\n    }\n\n    $output .= \"</div>\";\n    \n    return $output;\n}\n```"]}

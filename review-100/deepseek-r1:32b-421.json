{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to accept some parameters. The user's name and their review are essential. Maybe also the rating, but that could be optional in case someone just wants to leave feedback without a star rating.\n\nNext, I need to handle database connectivity. So I'll require the host, username, password, and database name. That makes sense because each application might have different credentials.\n\nThen, the function should insert this review into a database table. Let me outline the steps: connect to the database, prepare an SQL statement to prevent SQL injection, bind parameters to placeholders, execute the query, check for errors, close the connection, and return success or failure messages.\n\nWait, what if the user doesn't provide a rating? I should set a default value in the function so that it's not required. That way, users can choose whether to include it or not.\n\nI should also handle any possible database errors gracefully. If something goes wrong during execution, like a connection issue or query failure, the function should throw an exception so the caller can catch and handle it appropriately.\n\nLet me structure the function step by step. Start with the parameters, establish the database connection using mysqli since it's more secure than mysql_, prepare the SQL statement with placeholders for user inputs to prevent injection attacks, bind each parameter to ensure proper data types, execute the query, check if it was successful, close the connection to free resources, and then return a success message. If any step fails, throw an exception with details.\n\nTesting this function is important too. I should make sure that all parameters are correctly handled, including cases where the rating isn't provided. Also, test error handling by simulating incorrect database credentials or queries to see if exceptions are thrown properly.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, putting it all together into code, making sure each part is clear and handles edge cases.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for user reviews. This function allows users to submit reviews, including their name, review text, and rating (on a scale of 1-5). The review is then stored in a database.\n\n```php\n<?php\n// User Review Function\nfunction submitReview($userName, $reviewText, $rating = null, $dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName) {\n    // Establish Database Connection\n    try {\n        $conn = new mysqli($dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName);\n        \n        // Check connection\n        if ($conn->connect_error) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        }\n        \n        // Prepare SQL statement to prevent SQL injection\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_name, review_text, rating, review_date) \n                              VALUES (?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\");\n        \n        if (!$stmt) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n        \n        // Bind parameters to placeholders\n        // s = string, i = integer, d = double\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"s?s\", $userName, $reviewText, $rating);\n        \n        // Execute the statement\n        if (!$stmt->execute()) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n        \n        // Close connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $conn->close();\n        \n        return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Handle any exceptions and return error message\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$userName = \"John Doe\";\n$reviewText = \"This is a great product!\";\n$rating = 5; // Optional, can be omitted or set to null\n\n$dbHost = \"localhost\";\n$dbUser = \"root\";\n$dbPass = \"\";\n$dbName = \"my_database\";\n\n$result = submitReview($userName, $reviewText, $rating, $dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName);\necho $result;\n\n// Note: Make sure your database table 'reviews' exists and has the following columns:\n/*\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    review_text TEXT NOT NULL,\n    rating TINYINT DEFAULT NULL CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),\n    review_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n*/\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Parameters:**\n   - `$userName`: User's name (required)\n   - `$reviewText`: The actual review text (required)\n   - `$rating` (optional): Numeric rating between 1 and 5 (can be omitted or set to null)\n   - Database connection details (`$dbHost`, `$dbUser`, `$dbPass`, `$dbName`)\n\n2. **Database Connection:**\n   - Uses `mysqli` for database connectivity\n   - Includes error handling if the connection fails\n\n3. **SQL Injection Prevention:**\n   - Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n   - Binds parameters separately from the query\n\n4. **Optional Rating Parameter:**\n   - If `$rating` is not provided, it will be set to `null`\n   - The database table can handle null values for ratings\n\n5. **Error Handling:**\n   - Catches exceptions and returns meaningful error messages\n   - Properly closes database connections even if an error occurs\n\n6. **Return Value:**\n   - Returns a success message upon successful submission\n   - Returns an error message if something goes wrong\n\n### Requirements:\n\n- Make sure your database table is properly created with the correct columns.\n- Replace the database connection details (`$dbHost`, `$dbUser`, `$dbPass`, `$dbName`) with your actual database credentials.\n\n### How to Use:\n\n1. Call the `submitReview()` function with the required parameters.\n2. The function will handle the rest, including database connectivity and error handling.\n3. Check the returned message to determine if the review was successfully submitted or if there was an error.\n\nThis function provides a secure and efficient way to collect user reviews while preventing common security issues like SQL injection.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// User Review Function\nfunction submitReview($userName, $reviewText, $rating = null, $dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName) {\n    // Establish Database Connection\n    try {\n        $conn = new mysqli($dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName);\n        \n        // Check connection\n        if ($conn->connect_error) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        }\n        \n        // Prepare SQL statement to prevent SQL injection\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_name, review_text, rating, review_date) \n                              VALUES (?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\");\n        \n        if (!$stmt) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Prepare failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n        \n        // Bind parameters to placeholders\n        // s = string, i = integer, d = double\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"s?s\", $userName, $reviewText, $rating);\n        \n        // Execute the statement\n        if (!$stmt->execute()) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Execute failed: \" . $conn->error);\n        }\n        \n        // Close connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $conn->close();\n        \n        return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Handle any exceptions and return error message\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$userName = \"John Doe\";\n$reviewText = \"This is a great product!\";\n$rating = 5; // Optional, can be omitted or set to null\n\n$dbHost = \"localhost\";\n$dbUser = \"root\";\n$dbPass = \"\";\n$dbName = \"my_database\";\n\n$result = submitReview($userName, $reviewText, $rating, $dbHost, $dbUser, $dbPass, $dbName);\necho $result;\n\n// Note: Make sure your database table 'reviews' exists and has the following columns:\n/*\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    review_text TEXT NOT NULL,\n    rating TINYINT DEFAULT NULL CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),\n    review_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n*/\n?>\n```"]}

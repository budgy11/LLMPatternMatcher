It also records the timestamp.\n* **Getters:**  Provides getter methods (`getProductId`, `getUserId`, `getRating`, `getComment`, `getTimestamp`) to access the review properties. This is good practice for encapsulation.\n* **`__toString()` Method:**  Implements the `__toString()` method, so when you `echo` a `Review` object, you get a readable string representation. This is incredibly useful for debugging.\n* **`getId()` Method:**  Adds a `getId()` method to generate a unique ID for each review.  In a real application, you'd use an auto-incrementing database column for this.\n* **`formatReview()` Function:**  This function now takes a `Review` object and returns a user-friendly string representation of the review, including HTML escaping with `htmlspecialchars` to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n* **HTML Escaping:** The `formatReview` function uses `htmlspecialchars()` to escape the comment. *Crucially important* to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities.  If you allow user input to be directly displayed, it can be exploited to inject malicious code.\n* **Example Usage:** Clearer example of how to create `Review` objects and use the `formatReview()` function.\n* **Basic Storage Example:**  Shows how you might store reviews in an array. *Important:* This is just for demonstration; in a real application, you would store reviews in a database.\n* **Comments and Documentation:**  Includes detailed comments explaining the code and its purpose.\n* **Error Handling / Validation (Not implemented, but discussed):**  The example doesn't include extensive validation (e.g., checking that the rating is within a valid range).  In a production environment, you would *definitely* add validation to ensure the data is correct before storing it.\n* **Encapsulation:**  The code now adheres to good object-oriented practices by using a class to contain data and methods, improving maintainability and reusability.\n\nHow to use and extend this code:\n\n1. **Save:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `reviews.php`).\n2. **Run:**  Run the file from your web server or command line (e.g., `php reviews.php`).\n\n**Further improvements and what you would do in a real application:**\n\n* **Database Integration:**  Store the reviews in a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) instead of an array.  This is essential for scalability and reliability.\n* **Validation:**  Add robust validation to the `Review` class to ensure that the rating is within the expected range (e.g., 1-5) and that the comment is not empty.\n* **Sanitization:** Sanitize user input more thoroughly to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.\n* **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations (e.g., database connection errors).\n* **More advanced formatting:**  Customize the `formatReview()` function to produce different output formats (e.g., HTML for a website display).\n* **Authentication/Authorization:** Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to review submission and modification.\n* **Pagination:**  If you have a large number of reviews, implement pagination to display them in smaller chunks.\n* **Sorting/Filtering:** Add options to sort reviews by rating, date, or other criteria and filter them based on specific criteria.\n* **Review moderation:**  Add a system for moderators to review and approve reviews before they are displayed publicly.\n* **Related Products/Services:**  Associate reviews with the products or services they are referring to.\n\nThis improved example provides a solid foundation for creating a more complete review system in PHP.  Remember to prioritize security and data integrity throughout the development process.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Reviews class to handle user reviews for a product or service.\n */\nclass Review {\n\n  private $productId;\n  private $userId;\n  private $rating;\n  private $comment;\n  private $timestamp;\n\n\n  /**\n   * Constructor for the Review class.\n   *\n   * @param int $productId The ID of the product or service being reviewed.\n   * @param int $userId The ID of the user submitting the review.\n   * @param int $rating The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n   * @param string $comment The user's review comment.\n   */\n  public function __construct($productId, $userId, $rating, $comment) {\n    $this->productId = $productId;\n    $this->userId = $userId;\n    $this->rating = $rating;\n    $this->comment = $comment;\n    $this->timestamp = time(); // Record the current timestamp\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Getters for the review properties.\n   *\n   * @return mixed\n   */\n  public function getProductId() {\n    return $this->productId;\n  }\n\n  public function getUserId() {\n    return $this->userId;\n  }\n\n  public function getRating() {\n    return $this->rating;\n  }\n\n  public function getComment() {\n    return $this->comment;\n  }\n\n  public function getTimestamp() {\n    return $this->timestamp;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   *  Returns a string representation of the review object.

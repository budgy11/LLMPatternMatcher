{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. Maybe they have a website where users can leave reviews on products or services and want to display those reviews with some structure.\n\nFirst, I should consider how the reviews are stored. Probably in a database, so I'll need a table for reviews. It should include fields like review ID, user ID, product ID, rating, comment, timestamp, and maybe whether it's approved by an admin. That makes sense because not all reviews might be appropriate.\n\nNext, I need to think about the functionalities required. The function should display reviews for a specific product, allow users to submit new reviews, and handle the approval process. So, I'll break it down into sections: displaying existing reviews, adding a new review, and showing an admin approve button.\n\nFor displaying reviews, I'll fetch data from the database where the product ID matches. Then loop through each review, display user info, rating stars, comment, date, and maybe some helpfulness buttons. I should also calculate the average rating to show overall satisfaction.\n\nWhen adding a new review, I need an HTML form with fields for name, email (optional), rating as radio buttons, and a text area for comments. The form submission will go to a PHP script that inserts into the database, handling validation to prevent SQL injection and ensure required fields are filled.\n\nAdmin approval is another part. Each review could have an approve button that triggers a function in the backend. This would update the approved field in the database, allowing only approved reviews to be displayed publicly.\n\nI should also consider security aspects like sanitizing inputs, using prepared statements with PDO or mysqli to prevent SQL injection. Additionally, error handling is important so users know if something went wrong when submitting a review.\n\nMaybe I'll include some example HTML and CSS for styling the reviews, making them user-friendly. The CSS can style the rating stars, layout of each review comment, and buttons for approving or marking as helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will involve connecting to the database, querying data, displaying it with proper formatting, handling form submissions securely, and providing admin controls. I should structure the code clearly, separating display logic from submission logic and ensuring it's easy to understand and maintain.\n\nI also need to make sure the example is comprehensive but not too complex, so the user can adapt it to their specific needs. Including comments in the code might help them understand each part better.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for displaying user reviews on a product or service:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to display user reviews\nfunction displayUserReviews($product_id) {\n    // Database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\n    \n    // SQL query to fetch reviews\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = $product_id ORDER BY review_date DESC\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n    \n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        // Calculate average rating\n        $average_rating_sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) AS avg_rating FROM reviews WHERE product_id = $product_id\";\n        $average_rating_result = mysqli_query($conn, $average_rating_sql);\n        $average_rating_row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($average_rating_result);\n        $average_rating = number_format((float)$average_rating_row['avg_rating'], 1, '.', '');\n        \n        echo \"<div class='reviews-container'>\";\n        echo \"<h3>Customer Reviews</h3>\";\n        echo \"<p>Average Rating: $average_rating/5</p>\";\n        \n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            // Review details\n            $user_id = $row['user_id'];\n            $rating = $row['rating'];\n            $comment = $row['review_comment'];\n            $date = $row['review_date'];\n            \n            // Get user info\n            $user_sql = \"SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = $user_id\";\n            $user_result = mysqli_query($conn, $user_sql);\n            $user_row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($user_result);\n            $username = $user_row['username'];\n            $email = $user_row['email'];\n            \n            // Display review\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<div class='review-header'>\";\n            echo \"<span class='username'>$username</span>\";\n            echo \"<span class='date'>($date)</span>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n            \n            // Display rating stars\n            echo \"<div class='rating'>\";\n            for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n                if ($i <= $rating) {\n                    echo \"<span class='star'>\u2605</span>\";\n                } else {\n                    echo \"<span class='star'>\u2606</span>\";\n                }\n            }\n            echo \"</div>\";\n            \n            // Display comment\n            echo \"<p class='comment'>$comment</p>\";\n            \n            // Review actions\n            echo \"<div class='review-actions'>\";\n            echo \"<button class='helpful'>Helpful</button>\";\n            if (isset($_SESSION['admin'])) {\n                echo \"<button onclick='approveReview($row[review_id])'>Approve</button>\";\n            }\n            echo \"</div>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n        \n        // Close database connection\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"<p>No reviews available for this product.</p>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\ndisplayUserReviews(1);\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes the following features:\n\n1.

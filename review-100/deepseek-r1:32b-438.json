{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function in PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should take three parameters: content ID, user ID, and rating. That makes sense because each review is linked to specific content and a user.\n\nNext, I'll need to handle database connections. Maybe using PDO for better security and flexibility. So, I'll create a new PDO instance with the necessary credentials.\n\nI should check if the user has already reviewed the content to prevent multiple submissions. That means running a SELECT query on the reviews table where both content_id and user_id match. If a result is found, return an error message.\n\nIf no existing review is found, I'll proceed to insert the new rating into the database. Using a prepared statement for this will help prevent SQL injection. After insertion, it's good practice to check if the query was successful and handle any errors.\n\nThen, I need to calculate the average rating for that content. This involves another SELECT query to get all ratings for the content ID, compute the average, round it, and return it along with a success message.\n\nWait, I should make sure that all database operations are properly handled. Using try-catch blocks can help manage exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the structure of the reviews table. It should have columns like review_id, content_id, user_id, rating, and timestamp. That way, each review is uniquely identified and has necessary metadata.\n\nTesting the function with sample data would be important. For example, inserting a valid review, checking if it's added correctly, verifying the average rating updates, and testing edge cases like duplicate reviews or invalid inputs.\n\nI should also think about security aspects. Sanitizing inputs where necessary, using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, and ensuring that only numeric ratings are accepted within a valid range (like 1-5).\n\nFinally, returning appropriate messages and results will help the user understand the outcome of their review submission.\n</think>\n\nTo create a user review function in PHP, we'll need to:\n\n1. Connect to a database\n2. Insert a new review\n3. Calculate the average rating for content\n\nHere's an example using `PDO` (PHP Data Objects):\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction addReview($contentId, $userId, $rating) {\n    try {\n        // Database configuration\n        $host = 'localhost';\n        $db   = 'your_database_name';\n        $user = 'your_username';\n        $pass = 'your_password';\n\n        // Create a new PDO instance\n        $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db\", $user, $pass);\n        \n        // Check if user already reviewed this content\n        $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT review_id FROM reviews WHERE content_id = ? AND user_id = ?');\n        $stmt->execute([$contentId, $userId]);\n        if ($stmt->rowCount() > 0) {\n            return ['error' => 'You have already reviewed this content.'];\n        }\n        \n        // Insert new review\n        $stmt = $pdo->prepare('INSERT INTO reviews (content_id, user_id, rating) VALUES (?, ?, ?)');\n        $result = $stmt->execute([$contentId, $userId, $rating]);\n        \n        if (!$result) {\n            return ['error' => 'Error adding review. Please try again.'];\n        }\n        \n        // Calculate average rating\n        $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT AVG(rating) as avg_rating FROM reviews WHERE content_id = ?');\n        $stmt->execute([$contentId]);\n        $averageRating = $stmt->fetch()['avg_rating'];\n        \n        return ['success' => true, 'average_rating' => round($averageRating, 1)];\n        \n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        return ['error' => 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage()];\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$contentId = 5;\n$userId = 3;\n$rating = 4;\n\n$result = addReview($contentId, $userId, $rating);\n\nif (isset($result['success'])) {\n    echo \"Review added successfully! Average rating: \" . $result['average_rating'];\n} else {\n    echo $result['error'];\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database using PDO\n2. Checks if the user has already reviewed the content\n3. Adds a new review if it doesn't exist\n4. Calculates and returns the average rating for that content\n5. Handles errors appropriately\n\nMake sure to:\n\n- Replace database credentials with your actual database information\n- Create appropriate database tables (reviews table should include at least content_id, user_id, rating)\n- Ensure ratings are validated before being inserted into the database\n- Add proper error handling and security measures as needed for your application\n\nKey features:\n\n- Prevents multiple reviews from the same user for the same content\n- Calculates average rating\n- Uses prepared statements to help prevent SQL injection\n- Returns structured response with success/error messages", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction addReview($contentId, $userId, $rating) {\n    try {\n        // Database configuration\n        $host = 'localhost';\n        $db   = 'your_database_name';\n        $user = 'your_username';\n        $pass = 'your_password';\n\n        // Create a new PDO instance\n        $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db\", $user, $pass);\n        \n        // Check if user already reviewed this content\n        $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT review_id FROM reviews WHERE content_id = ?

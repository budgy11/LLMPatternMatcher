{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the function needs to do. It should allow users to submit reviews, display them, and maybe handle things like validation and storage. But since it's just a function, maybe it'll focus on displaying the reviews once they're stored.\n\nI'll start by setting up an array of review data. Each review should have an ID, user name, comment, rating, and timestamp. That makes sense because each review needs to be unique, attributed to a user, have their feedback, show how many stars they gave, and when they submitted it.\n\nNext, I need to display these reviews. So the function will loop through each review in the array and output HTML for each one. I'll use PHP's foreach loop for that.\n\nFor the rating, I can't just print the number; I should display stars. I'll create a helper function called get_stars that takes the rating and returns a string of star emojis. Full stars for whole numbers and half stars for .5 ratings. So if someone gives 4.5 stars, it's four full and one half.\n\nI also need to format the timestamp. Using date() with 'j M Y H:i' will make it look nice, like \"12 Jan 2023 14:30\".\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure each review as a div inside another container. Each review shows the user's name, their comment, stars, and the date.\n\nI should test this by adding some sample reviews to see if everything displays correctly. That way, I can ensure the function works as expected before integrating it into a larger application.\n\nOh, right, since this is just a display function, it doesn't handle form submission or database storage. So in a real app, I'd need separate functions for submitting reviews and fetching them from a database. But for now, the focus is on displaying the data provided.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, I'll write the code with these considerations in mind.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction display_reviews() {\n    // Sample review data (you would typically get this from a database)\n    $reviews = array(\n        array(\n            'id' => 1,\n            'user_name' => 'John Doe',\n            'comment' => 'Great service! I had an amazing experience.',\n            'rating' => 5,\n            'timestamp' => time() - (86400 * 3) // 3 days ago\n        ),\n        array(\n            'id' => 2,\n            'user_name' => 'Jane Smith',\n            'comment' => 'The staff was very helpful, but the wait time could be improved.',\n            'rating' => 4,\n            'timestamp' => time() - (86400 * 1) // 1 day ago\n        ),\n        array(\n            'id' => 3,\n            'user_name' => 'Bob Johnson',\n            'comment' => 'Not the best experience. Will not return.',\n            'rating' => 2,\n            'timestamp' => time() - (86400 * 7) // 1 week ago\n        )\n    );\n\n    // Display reviews\n    echo '<div class=\"reviews-container\">';\n    \n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        // Format timestamp\n        $formatted_date = date('j M Y H:i', $review['timestamp']);\n        \n        // Get star rating\n        $stars = get_stars($review['rating']);\n        \n        echo <<<HTML\n            <div class=\"review-item\">\n                <h4>{$review['user_name']}</h4>\n                <p>{$review['comment']}</p>\n                <div class=\"rating\">$stars</div>\n                <small>{$formatted_date}</small>\n            </div>\n            \nHTML;\n    }\n    \n    echo '</div>';\n}\n\n// Helper function to display stars based on rating\nfunction get_stars($rating) {\n    $full_stars = floor($rating);\n    $has_half_star = ($rating - $full_stars) >= 0.5;\n    $stars_html = '';\n    \n    for ($i = 0; $i < $full_stars; $i++) {\n        $stars_html .= '\u2605';\n    }\n    \n    if ($has_half_star) {\n        $stars_html .= '\u2be8'; // Half star emoji\n    }\n    \n    return $stars_html;\n}\n\n// Call the function to display reviews\ndisplay_reviews();\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes:\n\n1. A `display_reviews()` function that shows user reviews.\n\n2. A sample array of review data (in a real application, this would come from a database).\n\n3. Formatting for each review including:\n   - User name\n   - Comment\n   - Star rating\n   - Timestamp\n\n4. A helper function `get_stars()` to display stars based on the numeric rating.\n\n5. CSS styling could be added to improve the visual presentation (though it's not included in this example).\n\nTo use this in a real application, you would need to:\n\n1. Connect to your database\n2. Retrieve the reviews from your database table\n3. Add proper validation and sanitization for user input\n4. Implement sorting and filtering functionality if needed\n5. Add error handling\n6. Include CSS styling to make it look good\n\nYou can customize the output by modifying the HTML structure and adding more features as needed.\n\nRemember to replace the sample review data with actual data from your database in a production environment.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction display_reviews() {\n    // Sample review data (you would typically get this from a database)\n    $reviews = array(\n        array(\n            'id' => 1,\n            'user_name' => 'John Doe',\n            'comment' => 'Great service!

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to handle multiple parameters: user ID, product ID, rating, and comments. So, I'll define the function with these as arguments.\n\nNext, connecting to the database is essential. I remember using mysqli_connect in PHP. I should include the host, username, password, and database name. Maybe I should set up error handling in case the connection fails.\n\nOnce connected, I need an SQL query to insert the review into the reviews table. The placeholders will be for each parameter. Using prepared statements with mysqli_prepare would help prevent SQL injection. I'll bind the parameters using mysqli_stmt_bind_param with appropriate data types: i for integers and s for strings.\n\nAfter executing the statement, checking if there were any errors is important. If it fails, returning false makes sense. Otherwise, return true to indicate success.\n\nI should also ensure that the database connection is closed properly after the operation to free up resources.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll write the function step by step: connect, prepare, bind, execute, check for errors, close, and return the result.\n\nTesting would be good, but since this is just the function, maybe in another part of the code, the user will call it with actual data. I should make sure to handle any potential issues like invalid parameters or database connection problems gracefully.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that handles user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $username = \"root\";\n    $password = \"\";\n    $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Create a new database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check if connection was successful\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    // SQL query to insert review into the reviews table\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comments)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n\n    // Prepare the statement\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);\n\n    // Bind parameters to the statement\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments);\n\n    // Execute the statement\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        // Close the statement and connection\n        mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n        return true; // Review submitted successfully\n    } else {\n        // Close the statement and connection\n        mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n        return false; // Error submitting review\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Creates a database connection\n2. Prepares an SQL statement to insert a new review\n3. Binds parameters to prevent SQL injection\n4. Executes the query\n5. Returns true if successful, false otherwise\n\nTo use this function:\n\n```php\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 101;\n$rating = 5;\n$comments = \"Great product! Highly recommended.\";\n\nif (submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments)) {\n    echo \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error submitting review.\";\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to:\n\n1. Replace the database connection details with your actual database information\n2. Ensure proper error handling and security measures\n3. Validate user input before processing\n4. Sanitize any output data\n\nYou might also want to add additional features like:\n- Review validation (e.g., ensure rating is between 1-5)\n- User authentication/authorization checks\n- Timestamp tracking\n- Review moderation capabilities\n- Error logging\n- Input sanitization", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $username = \"root\";\n    $password = \"\";\n    $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Create a new database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check if connection was successful\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    // SQL query to insert review into the reviews table\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comments)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n\n    // Prepare the statement\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $sql);\n\n    // Bind parameters to the statement\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comments);\n\n    // Execute the statement\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        // Close the statement and connection\n        mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n        return true; // Review submitted successfully\n    } else {\n        // Close the statement and connection\n        mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n        return false; // Error submitting review\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 101;\n$rating = 5;\n$comments = \"Great product!

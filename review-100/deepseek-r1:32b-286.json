{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to create a PHP function for a user review system. Let me think about what this entails.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the requirements. The function should allow users to post reviews with ratings and comments. It should also display these reviews along with an average rating. Plus, there needs to be a way to delete reviews if necessary.\n\nSo, I'll start by setting up a basic HTML structure. I'll include sections for submitting a review, displaying the average rating, and showing each review. Each review should have the user's name, their comment, the date they posted it, the rating stars, and a delete button.\n\nNext, I'll need to handle the submission. When a user submits a review, the form should send data to a PHP script. I'll use AJAX so that the page doesn't reload. The script will insert the review into a database table. But wait, I don't want SQL injection, so I'll use prepared statements with mysqli.\n\nNow, for displaying the reviews. After submission, I need to fetch all reviews from the database and display them. Again, using AJAX to load the reviews without reloading the page makes sense. The PHP script will select all reviews, order them by date, and return them as JSON so JavaScript can render them on the page.\n\nI should also calculate the average rating. Each time a review is added or deleted, I'll need to recalculate this average. So in my display script, I'll compute it by summing all ratings and dividing by the count of reviews.\n\nDeleting a review requires another AJAX call. The delete button for each review will send the review ID to a PHP script that removes it from the database. Again, using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection is important here too.\n\nI need to make sure all the necessary functions are included. I'll create functions for inserting a review, deleting a review, and fetching reviews along with their count and average rating. Each function will handle its specific task and return appropriate data.\n\nTesting is crucial. I should check that submitting a review works correctly, that the average updates, and that deleting a review removes it from display and adjusts the average accordingly. Also, ensuring that all inputs are validated both on the client side with JavaScript and server side with PHP to prevent any malicious data from being entered.\n\nI might also consider user authentication in a real-world scenario, but since the user didn't specify that, I'll leave it out for now. Maybe add a note about it for completeness.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the code clearly, separating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP sections. Providing comments within each section will help anyone reading the code understand what's happening.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to create or display reviews for a product/service\nfunction user_review($product_id) {\n    // Database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\n    \n    // Get all reviews for the product\n    $reviews_query = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ? ORDER BY review_date DESC\";\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $reviews_query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"i\", $product_id);\n    mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n    $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n    \n    // Check if there are any reviews\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        \n        // Calculate average rating\n        $average_rating_query = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?\";\n        $avg_stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $average_rating_query);\n        mysqli_stmt_bind_param($avg_stmt, \"i\", $product_id);\n        mysqli_stmt_execute($avg_stmt);\n        $avg_result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($avg_stmt);\n        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($avg_result);\n        $average = number_format((float)$row['average'], 1, '.', '');\n        \n        echo \"<div class='average-rating'>\";\n        echo \"Average Rating: $average/5\";\n        echo \"</div>\";\n        \n        // Display each review\n        while ($review = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>Reviewer: \" . htmlspecialchars($review['username']) . \"</h3>\";\n            echo \"<p>Rating: \";\n            for ($i = 0; $i < $review['rating']; $i++) {\n                echo \"<span class='star'>\u2605</span>\";\n            }\n            echo \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>Review: \" . htmlspecialchars($review['comment']) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>Date: \" . date(\"F j, Y\", strtotime($review['review_date'])) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n        \n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews yet. Be the first to review this product!\";\n    }\n    \n    // Close database connection\n    mysqli_close($conn);\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function does several things:\n\n1. It connects to a MySQL database.\n2. Retrieves all reviews for a specific product using the provided `$product_id`.\n3. Calculates and displays the average rating of all reviews.\n4. Displays each review with user information, rating stars, comment, and date.\n\nTo use this function in your PHP application, you would call it like this:\n\n```php\n<?php\n$product_id = 1; // Replace with actual product ID\nuser_review($product_id);\n?>\n```\n\nYou'll need to customize the database connection details (username, password, database_name) according to your setup.\n\nTo add new reviews, you'd need a separate form and function to handle the submission:\n\n```php\n// Function to submit a new review\nfunction submit_review($product_id, $username, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\n    \n    // Insert new review into database\n    $insert_query = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, username, rating, comment, review_date) \n                    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $insert_query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"isii\", $product_id, $username, $rating, $comment);\n    \n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        echo \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error submitting review: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n    \n    // Close database connection\n    mysqli_close($conn);\n}\n?>\n```\n\nAnd the HTML form for submitting reviews:\n\n```html\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"submit_review.php\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"product_id\" value=\"<?php echo $product_id; ?>\">\n    <label>Username:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" required>\n    \n    <label>Rating:</label>\n    <select name=\"rating\" required>\n        <option value=\"\">Choose a rating</option>\n        <option value=\"5\">5 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n        <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n    </select>\n    \n    <label>Comment:</label>\n    <textarea name=\"comment\" required></textarea>\n    \n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n</form>\n```\n\nFeatures of this review system:\n\n1. Displays average rating\n2. Shows individual reviews with ratings and comments\n3. Includes timestamp for each review\n4. Easy to customize the display using CSS\n5. Secure against SQL injection through prepared statements\n\nRemember to create a `reviews` table in your database with the following columns:\n- review_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n- product_id (INT)\n- username (VARCHAR)\n- rating (INT)\n- comment (TEXT)\n- review_date (DATETIME)\n\nTo delete reviews, you could add an additional function:\n\n```php\n// Function to delete a review\nfunction delete_review($review_id) {\n    $conn = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\n    \n    $delete_query = \"DELETE FROM reviews WHERE review_id = ?\";\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $delete_query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"i\", $review_id);\n    \n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        echo \"Review deleted successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error deleting review: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n    \n    mysqli_close($conn);\n}\n?>\n```\n\nYou would need to add a delete button in the individual review display and handle it appropriately.\n\nThis is a basic implementation and you might want to add additional features like:\n- User authentication\n- Review validation\n- Spam prevention\n- Moderation system\n- Sorting reviews by date or rating\n- Loading more reviews as needed", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Function to create or display reviews for a product/service\nfunction user_review($product_id) {\n    // Database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\n    \n    // Get all reviews for the product\n    $reviews_query = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should handle submitting reviews and displaying them. So, I'll probably need two main parts: one for submission and another for display.\n\nFor the submission part, I'll need an HTML form with fields for the username and review text. When the user submits the form, PHP will handle storing the data. Since this is a basic example, maybe using a text file to store reviews would be simple enough. But in a real-world scenario, a database would be better.\n\nNext, handling the submission. I'll need to check if the form has been submitted and then process the input. I should sanitize the inputs to prevent any injection attacks. Using functions like htmlspecialchars can help with that.\n\nThen, saving the review. I'll write the sanitized data along with a timestamp into the text file. Each review can be stored as a separate line or in a structured format like JSON for easier parsing later.\n\nFor displaying the reviews, I'll read from the text file. If it's a simple text file, each line could represent one review, so I'll split the contents by lines and loop through them. Alternatively, if using JSON, I can decode the data into an array of reviews.\n\nI should also format the timestamp to be more readable. Using date() function with a suitable format like 'j F Y, H:i:s' would make it user-friendly.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the PHP script so that when the page loads, if there's a POST request, it processes the submission and redirects back or shows a message. Then, regardless of submission, it will display the reviews by reading from the file.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like handling empty inputs. Maybe add a check to ensure both username and review are provided before saving.\n\nTesting is important. I'll make sure that submitting a review correctly saves it and that displaying works as expected without errors.\n\nFinally, I'll present the code with clear comments so others can understand each part of the process.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to handle and display user reviews\nfunction user_reviews() {\n    $reviews_file = 'reviews.txt';\n    \n    // Check if form was submitted\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $username = htmlspecialchars($_POST['username']);\n        $review = htmlspecialchars($_POST['review']);\n        \n        // Add timestamp\n        $timestamp = date('j F Y, H:i:s');\n        \n        // Store the review in the file\n        $review_data = \"$username|$review|$timestamp\\n\";\n        file_put_contents($reviews_file, $review_data, FILE_APPEND);\n        \n        // Redirect back to the page to prevent form resubmission\n        header(\"Location: {$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']}\");\n        exit();\n    }\n    \n    // Display existing reviews\n    if (file_exists($reviews_file)) {\n        $reviews = file_get_contents($reviews_file);\n        $reviews = explode(\"\\n\", $reviews);\n        \n        echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n            $review_parts = explode(\"|\", $review);\n            if (count($review_parts) == 3) {\n                list($username, $review_text, $timestamp) = $review_parts;\n                echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n                echo \"<h4>$username</h4>\";\n                echo \"<p>$review_text</p>\";\n                echo \"<small>Posted on: $timestamp</small>\";\n                echo \"</div>\";\n            }\n        }\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        // If no reviews exist, show a message\n        echo \"<p>No reviews yet. Be the first to leave a review!</p>\";\n    }\n    \n    // Display review form\n    echo <<<_FORM\n    <form action=\"{$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']}\" method=\"post\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" required>\n        <textarea name=\"review\" placeholder=\"Write your review here...\" required></textarea>\n        <button type=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n    </form>\n_FORM;\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes the following features:\n\n1. Creates a simple user review system\n2. Stores reviews in a text file (you could modify this to use a database)\n3. Displays existing reviews above the review form\n4. Includes basic sanitization of input data\n5. Adds timestamps to each review\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Save it as `review.php`\n2. Make sure the `reviews.txt` file has write permissions\n3. Include it on your webpage like this:\n```php\n<?php require_once('review.php'); ?>\n```\n\n4. Call the function in your HTML:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Product Review Page</title>\n    <style>\n        .reviews { margin: 20px; }\n        .review { border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; }\n        h4 { color: #333; margin-top: 0; }\n        textarea { width: 100%; height: 150px; margin: 10px 0; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <?php user_reviews(); ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNote: This is a basic example and you might want to add additional features such as:\n\n- User authentication\n- Review approval system\n- Rating system (stars)\n- Delete/edit functionality for reviews\n- Database storage instead of file storage\n- More robust input validation and sanitization\n\nRemember to secure your application by:\n- Properly sanitizing all user inputs\n- Using prepared statements if using a database\n- Implementing CSRF protection\n- Adding validation for required fields\n- Sanitizing output before displaying it to users", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Function to handle and display user reviews\nfunction user_reviews() {\n    $reviews_file = 'reviews.txt';\n    \n    // Check if form was submitted\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $username = htmlspecialchars($_POST['username']);\n        $review = htmlspecialchars($_POST['review']);\n        \n        // Add timestamp\n        $timestamp = date('j F Y, H:i:s');\n        \n        // Store the review in the file\n        $review_data = \"$username|$review|$timestamp\\n\";\n        file_put_contents($reviews_file, $review_data, FILE_APPEND);\n        \n        // Redirect back to the page to prevent form resubmission\n        header(\"Location: {$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']}\");\n        exit();\n    }\n    \n    // Display existing reviews\n    if (file_exists($reviews_file)) {\n        $reviews = file_get_contents($reviews_file);\n        $reviews = explode(\"\\n\", $reviews);\n        \n        echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n            $review_parts = explode(\"|\", $review);\n            if (count($review_parts) == 3) {\n                list($username, $review_text, $timestamp) = $review_parts;\n                echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n                echo \"<h4>$username</h4>\";\n                echo \"<p>$review_text</p>\";\n                echo \"<small>Posted on: $timestamp</small>\";\n                echo \"</div>\";\n            }\n        }\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        // If no reviews exist, show a message\n        echo \"<p>No reviews yet.

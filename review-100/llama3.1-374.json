{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "**User Review Function in PHP**\n=====================================\n\nThis example demonstrates how to create a simple user review system using PHP. We'll use a basic implementation with the following features:\n\n*   User reviews can be submitted and stored in an array.\n*   Each review has a rating (1-5) and a comment.\n*   The function will display all reviews for a specific product.\n\n**Code**\n--------\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// Sample data: Product ID and its corresponding reviews\n$reviews = [\n    1 => [\n        ['rating' => 4, 'comment' => 'Great product!'],\n        ['rating' => 3, 'comment' => 'It was okay.'],\n        ['rating' => 5, 'comment' => 'Love it!']\n    ],\n    2 => [\n        ['rating' => 1, 'comment' => 'Terrible experience.'],\n        ['rating' => 4, 'comment' => 'Good product but expensive.']\n    ]\n];\n\nfunction displayReviews($productId) {\n    global $reviews;\n\n    if (!isset($reviews[$productId])) {\n        echo \"No reviews for Product ID: $productId\";\n        return;\n    }\n\n    foreach ($reviews[$productId] as $review) {\n        echo \"Rating: {$review['rating']}/5 | Comment: {$review['comment']}\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\ndisplayReviews(1);\n\n?>\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n---------------\n\n*   We have an associative array `$reviews` where keys are product IDs and values are arrays of reviews for each product.\n*   The `displayReviews()` function takes a product ID as input, retrieves the corresponding reviews from the array, and displays them on the screen.\n\n**Example Output**\n-----------------\n\n```\nRating: 4/5 | Comment: Great product!\nRating: 3/5 | Comment: It was okay.\nRating: 5/5 | Comment: Love it!\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic user review system. You can extend this example by adding more features, such as:\n\n*   User authentication and authorization to allow users to submit reviews\n*   Data storage using a database instead of an array\n*   Filtering or sorting reviews based on rating, date, or other criteria\n\nRemember to adapt the code according to your specific requirements.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Sample data: Product ID and its corresponding reviews\n$reviews = [\n    1 => [\n        ['rating' => 4, 'comment' => 'Great product!'],\n        ['rating' => 3, 'comment' => 'It was okay.'],\n        ['rating' => 5, 'comment' => 'Love it!']\n    ],\n    2 => [\n        ['rating' => 1, 'comment' => 'Terrible experience.'],\n        ['rating' => 4, 'comment' => 'Good product but expensive.']\n    ]\n];\n\nfunction displayReviews($productId) {\n    global $reviews;\n\n    if (!isset($reviews[$productId])) {\n        echo \"No reviews for Product ID: $productId\";\n        return;\n    }\n\n    foreach ($reviews[$productId] as $review) {\n        echo \"Rating: {$review['rating']}/5 | Comment: {$review['comment']}\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\ndisplayReviews(1);\n\n?>\n```", null]}

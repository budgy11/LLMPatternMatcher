This is much more robust.\n    *  The `clearReviews` function now has a `error_log()` call in case of failure.\n* **Duplicate Prevention:** The `addReview` function now checks if the review already exists before adding it. This prevents duplicate entries in the file. This is important because repeated additions would quickly fill the file and potentially cause issues.\n* **`getAllReviews` Fix:**  The `getAllReviews` function now uses `array_slice()` to extract *only* the review strings from the array, removing empty strings that might result from the `explode` operation. This makes the result cleaner and more usable.\n* **Comments and Documentation:** The code is extensively commented to explain the purpose of each part.  The docblock describes the class and its methods.\n* **Example Usage:**  The code includes a clear example of how to use the `Review` class.\n* **File Persistence:** The `reviews.txt` file is used to persist the reviews between script executions.  This makes the review system functional even after the script restarts.\n* **Robustness:** The code is more robust and less likely to cause errors or crashes.\n* **Readability:** Code is formatted for readability.\n\nHow to run it:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `review_system.php`).\n2.  **Run from the command line:** Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.  Then, execute the script using `php review_system.php`.\n3. **Inspect `reviews.txt`:** The `reviews.txt` file will be created (or updated) in the same directory as the PHP script.  Open it to see the stored reviews.\n\n**Important Considerations and Next Steps (Beyond this Example):**\n\n* **Database:** For a real-world application, *strongly* consider using a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) instead of a text file. Databases are designed for storing structured data and provide much better performance, scalability, and data integrity.\n* **Security:**  This example is *not* secure.  In a production environment, you would need to:\n    * **Sanitize user input:** Validate and sanitize the `username` and `review` strings to prevent malicious code injection.\n    * **Authentication/Authorization:** Implement a system to verify users and control access to the review system.\n* **Scalability:**  The file-based approach is not scalable.  For a large number of reviews, performance will degrade significantly.\n* **More Features:**  You could add features such as:\n    * Rating systems\n    * User accounts\n    * Review moderation\n    * Search functionality\n* **File Locking:** If multiple processes or users might try to access and modify the `reviews.txt` file simultaneously, you'll need to implement file locking to prevent data corruption.  PHP's `flock()` function can be used for this purpose.  However, consider the database option first.\n* **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the `Review` class.\n\nThis improved answer provides a working, well-structured, and commented example of a simple review system.  It also highlights the key areas you need to consider when building a more robust and production-ready system.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Class Review\n *\n * This class provides a simple function to store and retrieve user reviews.\n * It uses a file to persist the reviews, allowing for basic persistence.\n *\n * Note: This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes.

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to take in parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. Those are essential for a review system. So I'll define the function with these as parameters.\n\nNext, I should connect to the database. I remember using mysqli_connect before. I'll need the host, username, password, and database name. Oh, wait, maybe I should use constants for security instead of hardcoding them. That's better practice.\n\nAfter connecting, I need to insert the review into the database. The table is probably called something like reviews_products. I should make sure the columns match: user_id, product_id, rating, comment, and date_created. Using a prepared statement would be good to prevent SQL injection. So I'll prepare an INSERT query with placeholders.\n\nI should handle any connection or query errors. Using mysqli_connect_error() for connection issues and checking if the statement is false before executing it. If there's an error during execution, I can return an error message.\n\nIf everything goes well, the function should return true to indicate success. Also, after inserting, I might want to show the new average rating. So maybe a helper function, like get_average_rating(), would be useful here. That function would query the database for the average rating of a product and return it formatted to two decimal places.\n\nPutting it all together: connect, prepare statement, bind parameters, execute, handle errors, then maybe call get_average_rating(). I should also ensure that comments are stored as text, not HTML, so any user input is properly escaped by PHP's mysqli functions.\n\nTesting the function with sample data would be important. For example, if a user submits a rating and comment, does it save correctly? And does the average update as expected?\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now I'll outline the steps in code: connect to the database, prepare and execute the insert statement, handle any errors, then return the result or an error message.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for handling user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $db_username = \"root\";\n    $db_password = \"\";\n    $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    // Check if rating is between 1 and 5\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5!\";\n    }\n\n    // Prepare SQL statement to prevent SQL injection\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews_products (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, date_created)\n                            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\");\n\n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        return \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n\n    // Bind parameters to the statement\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n    // Execute the statement\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        // Get the new average rating for the product\n        $average_rating = get_average_rating($product_id);\n        \n        // Close the statement and connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $conn->close();\n\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'success',\n            'message' => 'Review submitted successfully!',\n            'average_rating' => $average_rating\n        );\n    } else {\n        // Return error if execution failed\n        $error = \"Error: \" . $stmt->error;\n        $stmt->close();\n        $conn->close();\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'error',\n            'message' => $error\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n// Helper function to get average rating for a product\nfunction get_average_rating($product_id) {\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $db_username = \"root\";\n    $db_password = \"\";\n    $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews_products WHERE product_id = ?\");\n    \n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        return \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $product_id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        $average_rating = round($row['average'], 2); // Round to two decimal places\n        return $average_rating;\n    }\n\n    $stmt->close();\n    $conn->close();\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 1;\n$rating = 5;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n\n$result = submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\nif ($result['status'] == 'success') {\n    echo \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    echo \"New average rating: \" . $result['average_rating'];\n} else {\n    echo \"Error submitting review: \" . $result['message'];\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes:\n\n1. A `submit_review()` function that:\n   - Takes user input parameters (user_id, product_id, rating, comment)\n   - Validates the rating range\n   - Connects to a MySQL database\n   - Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n   - Inserts the review into the database\n   - Returns an array with status and message\n\n2. A `get_average_rating()` helper function that:\n   - Calculates and returns the average rating for a product\n   - Rounds the result to two decimal places\n\n3. Example usage showing how to call the submit_review() function\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Set up your database connection details (host, username, password, database name)\n2. Make sure your database has a table named `reviews_products` with columns:\n   - user_id\n   - product_id\n   - rating\n   - comment\n   - date_created\n3. Modify the parameters as needed for your specific use case\n\nKey features:\n\n- SQL injection prevention using prepared statements\n- Input validation for ratings (must be between 1 and 5)\n- Error handling with meaningful messages\n- Automatic calculation of average rating after submission\n- Clean separation of concerns with helper functions\n\nRemember to:\n- Replace the database connection details with your actual database credentials\n- Add proper error logging in production environments\n- Consider adding additional validation for user inputs (e.g., minimum comment length)\n- Implement proper authentication before submitting reviews", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $db_username = \"root\";\n    $db_password = \"\";\n    $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    // Check if rating is between 1 and 5\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5!\";\n    }\n\n    // Prepare SQL statement to prevent SQL injection\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews_products (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, date_created)\n                            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\");\n\n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        return \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n\n    // Bind parameters to the statement\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n    // Execute the statement\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        // Get the new average rating for the product\n        $average_rating = get_average_rating($product_id);\n        \n        // Close the statement and connection\n        $stmt->close();\n        $conn->close();\n\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'success',\n            'message' => 'Review submitted successfully!',\n            'average_rating' => $average_rating\n        );\n    } else {\n        // Return error if execution failed\n        $error = \"Error: \" . $stmt->error;\n        $stmt->close();\n        $conn->close();\n        return array(\n            'status' => 'error',\n            'message' => $error\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n// Helper function to get average rating for a product\nfunction get_average_rating($product_id) {\n    $host = \"localhost\";\n    $db_username = \"root\";\n    $db_password = \"\";\n    $database = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Connect to the database\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n    if (!$conn) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n    }\n\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews_products WHERE product_id = ?\");\n    \n    if ($stmt === false) {\n        return \"Error: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $product_id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        $average_rating = round($row['average'], 2); // Round to two decimal places\n        return $average_rating;\n    }\n\n    $stmt->close();\n    $conn->close();\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 1;\n$rating = 5;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n\n$result = submit_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\nif ($result['status'] == 'success') {\n    echo \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    echo \"New average rating: \" . $result['average_rating'];\n} else {\n    echo \"Error submitting review: \" . $result['message'];\n}\n?>\n```"]}

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for a user review system. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should take parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. So, I'll define the function with these as arguments.\n\nNext, I need to connect to a MySQL database. I'll use mysqli_connect for that. I should include placeholders for the host, username, password, and database name since those will vary based on the environment.\n\nOnce connected, I should check if there's an existing review from this user for the product. If there is, I need to update it instead of inserting a new one. That makes sense because a user can't submit multiple reviews for the same product.\n\nSo, I'll write two SQL queries: one to check for an existing review and another to insert or update based on that result.\n\nFor security, I should use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This is crucial when dealing with user inputs like ratings and comments.\n\nAfter preparing the statement, I'll bind the parameters. For the insert case, I have four parameters: product_id, user_id, rating, and comment. For updating, it's similar but specifically looking for the existing review.\n\nI should also handle any errors that might occur during query execution. If there's an error, returning false makes sense so the calling code knows something went wrong.\n\nFinally, if everything goes well, the function returns true to indicate success.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Connect to the database using mysqli_connect.\n2. Check for existing review with a SELECT query.\n3. Depending on the result, prepare an INSERT or UPDATE statement.\n4. Use prepared statements and bind parameters to prevent SQL injection.\n5. Execute the statement and handle any errors.\n6. Return true if successful, false otherwise.\n\nI think that covers the main points. I'll make sure to include comments in the code for clarity.\n</think>\n\nHere's a PHP function to create a user review system:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction create_user_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'your_username';\n    $password = 'your_password';\n    $database = 'your_database';\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $mysqli = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check if there is an existing review from this user for the product\n    $check_review_query = \"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ? AND product_id = ?\";\n    \n    $stmt = $mysqli->prepare($check_review_query);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $user_id, $product_id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        // Update existing review\n        $update_query = \"UPDATE reviews SET rating = ?, comment = ? WHERE user_id = ? AND product_id = ?\";\n        \n        $stmt = $mysqli->prepare($update_query);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"dssi\", $rating, $comment, $user_id, $product_id);\n    } else {\n        // Insert new review\n        $insert_query = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n        \n        $stmt = $mysqli->prepare($insert_query);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"iidi\", $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment);\n    }\n\n    // Execute the statement\n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error: \" . $stmt->error;\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\n**Features of this function:**\n\n1. **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to your MySQL database.\n\n2. **Check for Existing Review:** Before inserting a new review, it checks if the user has already submitted a review for that product. If they have, it updates the existing review instead of creating a new one.\n\n3. **Security:** Uses prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\n4. **Input Handling:** The function expects:\n   - `$user_id`: Unique identifier for the user\n   - `$product_id`: Unique identifier for the product being reviewed\n   - `$rating`: Numeric rating (typically between 1 and 5)\n   - `$comment`: Textual comment about the product\n\n5. **Return Value:** Returns `true` if the review was successfully inserted or updated, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**How to use this function:**\n\n```php\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 123;\n$product_id = 456;\n$rating = 5;\n$comment = \"Great product! Highly recommended.\";\n\nif (create_user_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n    echo \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error submitting review.\";\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. **Database Setup:** Make sure you have a `reviews` table in your database with the following columns:\n   - `id` (primary key)\n   - `product_id`\n   - `user_id`\n   - `rating`\n   - `comment`\n   - `timestamp` (optional)\n\n2. **Error Handling:** This function includes basic error handling, but you might want to add more sophisticated error logging depending on your needs.\n\n3. **Validation:** You should validate the input parameters before calling this function (e.g., ensure rating is a valid number within the expected range).\n\n4. **Security:** Replace the placeholder database connection details (`$host`, `$username`, etc.) with your actual database credentials.\n\n5. **Timestamp:** If you want to track when reviews were submitted, consider adding a `timestamp` column and include it in the INSERT/UPDATE queries.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction create_user_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'your_username';\n    $password = 'your_password';\n    $database = 'your_database';\n\n    // Connect to database\n    $mysqli = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n    // Check if there is an existing review from this user for the product\n    $check_review_query = \"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ?

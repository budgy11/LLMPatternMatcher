{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products or services. So, I'll need to collect data like the product ID, user ID, rating, and comment.\n\nI should start by setting up a database connection. I'll use mysqli because it's more secure and efficient than the older mysql functions. I'll create a new class called ReviewManager with a constructor that connects to the database using provided credentials.\n\nNext, I need methods to add reviews and retrieve them. The addReview method will take product ID, user ID, rating, and comment as parameters. It should insert this data into the reviews table. I should make sure to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\nFor retrieving reviews, the getReviews method will fetch all reviews for a specific product. Again, using prepared statements here is important. The method should return an array of review data including user details if possible, but since the database structure isn't detailed, I'll assume the necessary tables exist.\n\nI also need to handle displaying these reviews on a webpage. So, another method in the ReviewManager class will generate HTML content from the retrieved reviews. It will format each review with the user's name (or username), their rating as stars, and their comment.\n\nSecurity is crucial. I'll use prepared statements throughout to prevent SQL injection. Additionally, I should consider validating inputs on both the client and server sides to ensure data integrity.\n\nLooking at error handling, each method should check for errors like database connection issues or failed queries. Throwing exceptions will help in catching these errors gracefully in the application flow.\n\nIn the example usage provided, after creating a ReviewManager instance and adding a review, I need to fetch and display them. The displayReviews method will loop through the fetched data and construct HTML elements dynamically, making it easy to integrate into any webpage.\n\nI should also consider future enhancements, like allowing users to edit or delete their reviews, or implementing a rating system that calculates average ratings. But for now, the core functionality is covered: adding and displaying reviews securely.\n\nTesting each part step by step will be important. I'll test database connections, insertion of reviews, retrieval, and proper display on the frontend. Ensuring that all edge cases, like empty comments or invalid ratings, are handled appropriately.\n\nFinally, integrating this class into a larger application would involve including it where needed, instantiating the ReviewManager with correct credentials, and using its methods as shown in the example.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP. This example includes:\n\n1. A database connection\n2. Adding reviews\n3. Displaying reviews\n4. Rating system (1-5 stars)\n\n```php\n<?php\nclass ReviewManager {\n    private $conn;\n\n    public function __construct($host, $db_name, $username, $password) {\n        try {\n            $this->conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n            \n            if ($this->conn->connect_error) {\n                throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $this->conn->connect_error);\n            }\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            die(\"Connection Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Add a new review\n    public function addReview($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment) {\n        try {\n            if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n                throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5\");\n            }\n            \n            $stmt = $this->conn->prepare(\"\n                INSERT INTO reviews \n                (product_id, user_id, rating, comment, review_date)\n                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\n            \");\n            \n            $stmt->bind_param(\"iisi\", $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment);\n            \n            if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                return true;\n            } else {\n                throw new Exception(\"Error adding review: \" . $this->conn->error);\n            }\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            die(\"Review Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Get reviews for a product\n    public function getReviews($product_id, $limit = 5) {\n        try {\n            $stmt = $this->conn->prepare(\"\n                SELECT \n                    r.review_id,\n                    r.product_id,\n                    r.user_id,\n                    r.rating,\n                    r.comment,\n                    r.review_date,\n                    u.username\n                FROM reviews r\n                LEFT JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id\n                WHERE r.product_id = ?\n                ORDER BY review_date DESC\n                LIMIT ?\n            \");\n            \n            $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $product_id, $limit);\n            $stmt->execute();\n            \n            $result = $stmt->get_result();\n            \n            if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n                return $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);\n            } else {\n                return array();\n            }\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            die(\"Review Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Display reviews in HTML\n    public function displayReviews($reviews) {\n        if (empty($reviews)) {\n            return \"<p>No reviews available yet.</p>\";\n        }\n        \n        $html = \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        \n        foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n            $stars_html = str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $review['rating']) . str_repeat(\"\u2606\", 5 - $review['rating']);\n            \n            $html .= <<<HTML\n                <div class=\"review-item\">\n                    <div class=\"review-header\">\n                        <span class=\"username\">{$review['username']}</span>\n                        <div class=\"stars\">{$stars_html}</div>\n                    </div>\n                    <p class=\"comment\">{$review['comment']}</p>\n                    <small class=\"date\">Posted on {$review['review_date']}</small>\n                </div>\nHTML;\n        }\n        \n        $html .= \"</div>\";\n        \n        return $html;\n    }\n\n    // Close database connection\n    public function __destruct() {\n        if ($this->conn) {\n            $this->conn->close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\ntry {\n    // Create ReviewManager instance\n    $review_manager = new ReviewManager(\n        'localhost',          // Database host\n        'mydatabase',         // Database name\n        'username',           // Database username\n        'password'            // Database password\n    );\n\n    // Add a new review (assuming user_id 1 and product_id 1)\n    $product_id = 1;\n    $user_id = 1;\n    $rating = 5;\n    $comment = \"This is an amazing product!\";\n    \n    if ($review_manager->addReview($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n        echo \"Review added successfully!\";\n    }\n\n    // Get and display reviews\n    $reviews = $review_manager->getReviews(1); // Get reviews for product ID 1\n    \n    // Output the HTML\n    echo $review_manager->displayReviews($reviews);\n\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    die(\"Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis code provides:\n\n1. A class `ReviewManager` to handle all review-related operations\n\n2. Methods:\n   - `addReview()`: Adds a new review\n   - `getReviews()`: Retrieves reviews for a product\n   - `displayReviews()`: Formats the reviews into HTML\n   - Database connection handling with proper error checking\n\n3. Features:\n   - Secure database queries using prepared statements\n   - Rating validation (1-5 stars)\n   - Error handling and exceptions\n   - Clean separation of concerns\n\n4. To use this:\n\n   a. Create a `reviews` table in your database:\n      ```sql\n      CREATE TABLE reviews (\n          review_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n          product_id INT NOT NULL,\n          user_id INT NOT NULL,\n          rating TINYINT NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <=5),\n          comment TEXT NOT NULL,\n          review_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n      );\n      ```\n\n   b. Create a `users` table for usernames:\n      ```sql\n      CREATE TABLE users (\n          user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n          username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL\n      );\n      ```\n\n   c. Update the database connection details in the example usage\n\nNote: This is a basic implementation and can be extended with features like:\n\n- Review validation on client-side\n- Rating statistics (average rating, total reviews)\n- Review editing/deletion\n- Pagination for more reviews\n- Reporting system for inappropriate reviews\n- Moderation features\n- Sorting options ( newest/oldest/highest rated)", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nclass ReviewManager {\n    private $conn;\n\n    public function __construct($host, $db_name, $username, $password) {\n        try {\n            $this->conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $db_name);\n            \n            if ($this->conn->connect_error) {\n                throw new Exception(\"Connection failed: \" . $this->conn->connect_error);\n            }\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            die(\"Connection Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Add a new review\n    public function addReview($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment) {\n        try {\n            if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n                throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5\");\n            }\n            \n            $stmt = $this->conn->prepare(\"\n                INSERT INTO reviews \n                (product_id, user_id, rating, comment, review_date)\n                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\n            \");\n            \n            $stmt->bind_param(\"iisi\", $product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment);\n            \n            if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                return true;\n            } else {\n                throw new Exception(\"Error adding review: \" . $this->conn->error);\n            }\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            die(\"Review Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Get reviews for a product\n    public function getReviews($product_id, $limit = 5) {\n        try {\n            $stmt = $this->conn->prepare(\"\n                SELECT \n                    r.review_id,\n                    r.product_id,\n                    r.user_id,\n                    r.rating,\n                    r.comment,\n                    r.review_date,\n                    u.username\n                FROM reviews r\n                LEFT JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id\n                WHERE r.product_id = ?\n                ORDER BY review_date DESC\n                LIMIT ?\n            \");\n            \n            $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $product_id, $limit);\n            $stmt->execute();\n            \n            $result = $stmt->get_result();\n            \n            if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n                return $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);\n            } else {\n                return array();\n            }\n        } catch (Exception $e) {\n            die(\"Review Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Display reviews in HTML\n    public function displayReviews($reviews) {\n        if (empty($reviews)) {\n            return \"<p>No reviews available yet.</p>\";\n        }\n        \n        $html = \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        \n        foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n            $stars_html = str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $review['rating']) . str_repeat(\"\u2606\", 5 - $review['rating']);\n            \n            $html .= <<<HTML\n                <div class=\"review-item\">\n                    <div class=\"review-header\">\n                        <span class=\"username\">{$review['username']}</span>\n                        <div class=\"stars\">{$stars_html}</div>\n                    </div>\n                    <p class=\"comment\">{$review['comment']}</p>\n                    <small class=\"date\">Posted on {$review['review_date']}</small>\n                </div>\nHTML;\n        }\n        \n        $html .= \"</div>\";\n        \n        return $html;\n    }\n\n    // Close database connection\n    public function __destruct() {\n        if ($this->conn) {\n            $this->conn->close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\ntry {\n    // Create ReviewManager instance\n    $review_manager = new ReviewManager(\n        'localhost',          // Database host\n        'mydatabase',         // Database name\n        'username',           // Database username\n        'password'            // Database password\n    );\n\n    // Add a new review (assuming user_id 1 and product_id 1)\n    $product_id = 1;\n    $user_id = 1;\n    $rating = 5;\n    $comment = \"This is an amazing product!\";\n    \n    if ($review_manager->addReview($product_id, $user_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n        echo \"Review added successfully!\";\n    }\n\n    // Get and display reviews\n    $reviews = $review_manager->getReviews(1); // Get reviews for product ID 1\n    \n    // Output the HTML\n    echo $review_manager->displayReviews($reviews);\n\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    die(\"Error: \" . $e->getMessage());\n}\n?>\n```"]}

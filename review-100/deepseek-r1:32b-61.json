{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me break down what the user is asking for. They want a function that allows users to submit reviews and ratings for a product or service. So, first, I should outline the main components required for this.\n\nI'll start by considering the database structure. The reviews will need to be stored somewhere, so I'll create a table called 'reviews' with fields like review_id, user_id, product_id, rating, comment, and timestamp. This way, each review is tied to a specific user and product, making it easy to manage and retrieve later.\n\nNext, I need functions to handle adding reviews, displaying them, and calculating the average rating. For adding a review, I'll write a function called add_review that takes parameters like user_id, product_id, rating, and comment. It should insert this data into the database. To prevent SQL injection, I'll use prepared statements with placeholders.\n\nDisplaying the reviews is another key part. The display_reviews function will fetch all reviews for a given product_id from the database. It should retrieve each review along with the user's name to make it more user-friendly. I'll format each review as an HTML string, showing the user's name, rating as stars, comment, and timestamp.\n\nCalculating the average rating is essential for giving users an overview of the product's reception. The get_average_rating function will compute the average from all ratings in the reviews table for a specific product_id. It uses a SELECT AVG query to get the average and returns it formatted to one decimal place.\n\nI should also think about how these functions integrate into a larger application. For instance, when displaying a product page, I can call display_reviews and get_average_rating to show user feedback. Additionally, I'll need to handle user authentication so that only logged-in users can submit reviews. This might involve checking if the user is authenticated before allowing them to post a review.\n\nSecurity is a big consideration here. Using prepared statements helps prevent SQL injection, which is a common security risk. Also, validating inputs ensures that ratings are within 1-5 stars and comments aren't empty or excessively long. I'll need to add checks for these validations in the add_review function before inserting into the database.\n\nAnother thing to consider is how to display the average rating dynamically on the product page. The get_average_rating function returns a float, which can be formatted and displayed next to the product details. This gives users a quick glance at the overall sentiment towards the product.\n\nI should also think about scalability. If the application grows, the database might handle a large number of reviews. Using efficient queries and proper indexing on columns like product_id will help maintain performance. Additionally, pagination could be added later if there are many reviews to display, but for now, retrieving all at once is acceptable for simplicity.\n\nTesting each function individually is important. For example, I can test add_review by submitting a review through the application's interface and checking if it appears in the database. Similarly, testing get_average_rating by adding multiple reviews with different ratings and ensuring the average calculation is correct.\n\nI might also consider additional features like allowing users to edit or delete their reviews, but for this initial implementation, focusing on submission, display, and average rating suffices. These functions provide a solid foundation that can be expanded upon in the future.\n\nIn terms of user experience, displaying reviews with user names and timestamps adds credibility. Using stars for ratings makes it visually appealing and easy to understand at a glance. Formatting the timestamp to be human-readable improves clarity without overwhelming users with unnecessary details.\n\nFinally, I'll need to ensure that all functions are properly integrated into the application's flow. For instance, after a user submits a review, they should see their review appear on the product page immediately or upon refreshing. This requires proper handling of form submissions and redirects or reloads as needed.\n\nOverall, by structuring the database correctly and creating these three main functions\u2014add_review, display_reviews, and get_average_rating\u2014I can provide a functional user review system that enhances user interaction and provides valuable feedback for products or services.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP. This includes functions to add reviews, display reviews, and calculate average ratings:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection settings\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'your_username';\n$password = 'your_password';\n$database = 'your_database';\n\n// Connect to database\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment, $conn) {\n    // Sanitize input\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = intval($rating); // Ensure rating is an integer\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n    // Check if rating is valid (1-5)\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $query = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, timestamp)\n              VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n    \n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction display_reviews($product_id, $conn) {\n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    // Get all reviews for the product\n    $query = \"SELECT r.review_id, u.user_name, r.rating, r.comment, r.timestamp\n              FROM reviews r\n              JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id\n              WHERE r.product_id = ?\n              ORDER BY r.timestamp DESC\";\n\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"i\", $product_id);\n\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n\n        // Start output\n        echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            $user_name = $row['user_name'];\n            $rating = $row['rating'];\n            $comment = $row['comment'];\n            $timestamp = date('F j, Y g:i a', strtotime($row['timestamp']));\n\n            // Display review\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h4> Reviewed by \" . htmlspecialchars($user_name) . \"</h4>\";\n            echo \"<p><strong>Rating:</strong> \";\n            for ($i = 0; $i < $rating; $i++) {\n                echo \"&#9733;\";\n            }\n            echo \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($comment) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p class='timestamp'>\" . $timestamp . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        // Handle error\n        echo \"Error displaying reviews: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating\nfunction get_average_rating($product_id, $conn) {\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    $query = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?\";\n    \n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"i\", $product_id);\n\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($conn);\n\n?>\n```\n\nThis code provides:\n\n1. `add_review()`: Adds a new review to the database, including user ID, product ID, rating (1-5), and comment.\n\n2. `display_reviews()`: Retrieves and displays all reviews for a specific product, showing:\n   - User name\n   - Rating (displayed as stars)\n   - Comment\n   - Timestamp\n\n3. `get_average_rating()`: Calculates and returns the average rating for a specific product.\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Replace database connection details with your actual database information.\n2. Make sure you have tables set up in your database:\n   - A users table (with user_id and user_name)\n   - A reviews table (with review_id, user_id, product_id, rating, comment, timestamp)\n\nFeatures of this implementation:\n\n- Prevents SQL injection using prepared statements\n- Sanitizes input data\n- Displays ratings as star symbols\n- Formats timestamps in a readable format\n- Calculates average ratings\n- Maintains database security\n\nYou can customize the HTML output in the `display_reviews()` function to match your website's styling.\n\nTo use this system, you would typically:\n\n1. Display product details along with its reviews on a product page.\n2. Show a form where users can enter their rating and comment.\n3. When the user submits the review, validate it on both the client-side and server-side, then add it to the database using `add_review()`.\n4. After adding the review, display all reviews for that product using `display_reviews()`.\n\nRemember to:\n- Implement proper user authentication before allowing users to submit reviews\n- Add error handling for all functions\n- Validate and sanitize all inputs\n- Secure your database connection and queries", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Database connection settings\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'your_username';\n$password = 'your_password';\n$database = 'your_database';\n\n// Connect to database\n$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);\nif (!$conn) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment, $conn) {\n    // Sanitize input\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = intval($rating); // Ensure rating is an integer\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n    // Check if rating is valid (1-5)\n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Insert review into database\n    $query = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment, timestamp)\n              VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())\";\n    \n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iiss\", $user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment);\n\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction display_reviews($product_id, $conn) {\n    // Sanitize input\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    // Get all reviews for the product\n    $query = \"SELECT r.review_id, u.user_name, r.rating, r.comment, r.timestamp\n              FROM reviews r\n              JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.user_id\n              WHERE r.product_id = ?\n              ORDER BY r.timestamp DESC\";\n\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"i\", $product_id);\n\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n\n        // Start output\n        echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            $user_name = $row['user_name'];\n            $rating = $row['rating'];\n            $comment = $row['comment'];\n            $timestamp = date('F j, Y g:i a', strtotime($row['timestamp']));\n\n            // Display review\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h4> Reviewed by \" . htmlspecialchars($user_name) . \"</h4>\";\n            echo \"<p><strong>Rating:</strong> \";\n            for ($i = 0; $i < $rating; $i++) {\n                echo \"&#9733;\";\n            }\n            echo \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($comment) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<p class='timestamp'>\" . $timestamp . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n        echo \"</div>\";\n    } else {\n        // Handle error\n        echo \"Error displaying reviews: \" . mysqli_error($conn);\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating\nfunction get_average_rating($product_id, $conn) {\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n\n    $query = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?\";\n    \n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"i\", $product_id);\n\n    if (mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt)) {\n        $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n        $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n        return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\n// Close database connection\nmysqli_close($conn);\n\n?>\n```"]}

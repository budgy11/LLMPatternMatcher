{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user asked to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. Maybe they want a simple system where users can leave reviews on their website. Let me break down the key components that such a function should include.\n\nFirst, displaying the reviews is essential. Users should be able to see all the reviews posted by others. Then, adding new reviews would require a form where they can input their name and review text. I should also consider validation to make sure both fields are filled out before submitting.\n\nNext, calculating the average rating could be useful for giving an overview of user satisfaction. That means I'll need to store ratings, perhaps using a star system. Each review can have a rating from 1 to 5 stars, which we can display visually.\n\nStoring the reviews securely is important. Using MySQL with prepared statements will help prevent SQL injection attacks. I should set up a database table to hold each review's details like ID, user name, review text, rating, and timestamp.\n\nI'll also need functions for adding reviews, retrieving all reviews, and calculating the average rating. These functions can be kept in a separate PHP file for better organization. Including this file where needed will keep the main script clean.\n\nFor the frontend, I should design a form that's user-friendly. It should include fields for the user's name and their review. Stars can be added using radio buttons or a dropdown menu. Styling with CSS will make it look neat and encourage users to leave feedback.\n\nDisplaying the reviews in a structured way is important too. Each review should show the user's name, their comment, the stars they rated, and when they posted it. I'll loop through each review fetched from the database and format them accordingly on the page.\n\nI should also handle any potential errors gracefully. For example, if there are no reviews yet, displaying a message like \"No reviews available\" would be helpful instead of leaving the section blank or causing an error.\n\nTesting is crucial. I need to make sure that when a user submits a review, it correctly saves to the database and displays on the page immediately. Also, checking that the average rating updates properly after each submission will ensure everything works as intended.\n\nFinally, considering scalability, maybe in the future adding features like editing or deleting reviews could be useful, but for now, focusing on the basics is best. I'll outline these steps clearly so the user can implement them step by step.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that handles user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Connect to database\n$host = 'localhost';\n$dbUsername = 'username';\n$dbPassword = 'password';\n$dbName = 'reviews_db';\n\n$conn = new mysqli($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction displayReviews() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY review_id DESC\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    \n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>\" . htmlspecialchars($row['user_name']) . \"</h3>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($row['review_text']) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<div class='rating'>Rating: \" . $row['rating'] . \" stars</div>\";\n            echo \"<small>Posted on: \" . $row['timestamp'] . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"<div class='no-reviews'>No reviews available.</div>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction addReview($userName, $reviewText, $rating) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $userName = htmlspecialchars(trim($userName));\n    $reviewText = htmlspecialchars(trim($reviewText));\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    \n    if ($userName == \"\" || $reviewText == \"\") {\n        return \"Please fill in all required fields.\";\n    }\n    \n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5 stars.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Insert into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_name, review_text, rating, timestamp)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n    \n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"sss\", $userName, $reviewText, $rating);\n    \n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return \"Review added successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error adding review: \" . $conn->error;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating\nfunction getAverageRating() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    \n    if ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Close database connection\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```\n\nThis code provides the following functionality:\n\n1. Connects to a MySQL database\n\n2. `displayReviews()` function:\n   - Retrieves all reviews from the database\n   - Displays them in a formatted way with user name, review text, rating, and timestamp\n   - Shows \"No reviews available\" message if there are no reviews\n\n3. `addReview($userName, $reviewText, $rating)` function:\n   - Sanitizes inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks\n   - Validates that required fields are filled\n   - Checks that rating is between 1-5 stars\n   - Inserts new review into the database\n\n4. `getAverageRating()` function:\n   - Calculates and returns the average rating from all reviews\n   - Rounds to one decimal place for display purposes\n\nTo use this code, you'll need to:\n\n1. Set up a MySQL database with a table named \"reviews\" containing columns:\n   - review_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)\n   - user_name (VARCHAR)\n   - review_text (TEXT)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - timestamp (DATETIME)\n\n2. Create an HTML form for submitting reviews:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"submit_review.php\" method=\"post\">\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"user_name\" placeholder=\"Your Name\" required>\n    <textarea name=\"review_text\" placeholder=\"Write your review...\" required></textarea>\n    <select name=\"rating\">\n        <option value=\"5\">5 stars</option>\n        <option value=\"4\">4 stars</option>\n        <option value=\"3\">3 stars</option>\n        <option value=\"2\">2 stars</option>\n        <option value=\"1\">1 star</option>\n    </select>\n    <button type=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n3. Create a submit_review.php file to handle form submissions:\n\n```php\n<?php\ninclude 'review_functions.php';\n\n$reviewStatus = addReview($_POST['user_name'], $_POST['review_text'], $_POST['rating']);\n\nif ($reviewStatus == \"Review added successfully!\") {\n    header(\"Location: reviews_page.php\"); // Redirect back to reviews page\n} else {\n    echo $reviewStatus;\n}\n?>\n```\n\n4. Display the reviews on your webpage using:\n\n```php\n<?php include 'review_functions.php'; ?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Product Reviews</title>\n    <style>\n        .review {\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            padding: 15px;\n            margin-bottom: 10px;\n        }\n        .rating {\n            color: #ff9f00;\n            font-weight: bold;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h2>Product Reviews</h2>\n    \n    <!-- Average Rating -->\n    <div class=\"average-rating\">\n        <span>Average Rating:</span>\n        <?php \n        $avgRating = getAverageRating();\n        echo \"<span class='rating'>$avgRating stars</span>\";\n        ?>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Review Form -->\n    <?php include 'review_form.html'; ?>\n\n    <!-- Display Reviews -->\n    <?php displayReviews(); ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is a basic implementation that can be customized further based on your needs. You can:\n\n- Add more validation\n- Include user authentication\n- Implement review editing/deletion\n- Add more fields to the reviews (e.g., product ID, helpfulness votes)\n- Enhance the styling with CSS and JavaScript\n- Add pagination for long lists of reviews\n\nRemember to:\n- Keep your database credentials secure\n- Use proper error handling\n- Regularly back up your database\n- Sanitize all user inputs\n- Validate all data before displaying it", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Connect to database\n$host = 'localhost';\n$dbUsername = 'username';\n$dbPassword = 'password';\n$dbName = 'reviews_db';\n\n$conn = new mysqli($host, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);\n\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction displayReviews() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY review_id DESC\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    \n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>\" . htmlspecialchars($row['user_name']) . \"</h3>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($row['review_text']) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<div class='rating'>Rating: \" . $row['rating'] . \" stars</div>\";\n            echo \"<small>Posted on: \" . $row['timestamp'] . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"<div class='no-reviews'>No reviews available.</div>\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to add a new review\nfunction addReview($userName, $reviewText, $rating) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Sanitize inputs\n    $userName = htmlspecialchars(trim($userName));\n    $reviewText = htmlspecialchars(trim($reviewText));\n    $rating = intval($rating);\n    \n    if ($userName == \"\" || $reviewText == \"\") {\n        return \"Please fill in all required fields.\";\n    }\n    \n    if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5 stars.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Insert into database\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_name, review_text, rating, timestamp)\n            VALUES (?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\";\n    \n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"sss\", $userName, $reviewText, $rating);\n    \n    if ($stmt->execute()) {\n        return \"Review added successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Error adding review: \" . $conn->error;\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to calculate average rating\nfunction getAverageRating() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    $sql = \"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews\";\n    $result = $conn->query($sql);\n    \n    if ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n        return round($row['average'], 1); // Round to one decimal place\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Close database connection\n$conn->close();\n?>\n```", null, "```php\n<?php\ninclude 'review_functions.php';\n\n$reviewStatus = addReview($_POST['user_name'], $_POST['review_text'], $_POST['rating']);\n\nif ($reviewStatus == \"Review added successfully!\") {\n    header(\"Location: reviews_page.php\"); // Redirect back to reviews page\n} else {\n    echo $reviewStatus;\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n<?php include 'review_functions.php'; ?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Product Reviews</title>\n    <style>\n        .review {\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            padding: 15px;\n            margin-bottom: 10px;\n        }\n        .rating {\n            color: #ff9f00;\n            font-weight: bold;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h2>Product Reviews</h2>\n    \n    <!-- Average Rating -->\n    <div class=\"average-rating\">\n        <span>Average Rating:</span>\n        <?php \n        $avgRating = getAverageRating();\n        echo \"<span class='rating'>$avgRating stars</span>\";\n        ?>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Review Form -->\n    <?php include 'review_form.html'; ?>\n\n    <!-- Display Reviews -->\n    <?php displayReviews(); ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n```"]}

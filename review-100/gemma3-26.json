The constructor now includes the current date and time for the review's timestamp.\n   -  Provides getter methods (e.g., `getReviewId()`) for accessing the data.  This is good practice for encapsulation.\n   -  `displayReview()` method formats and prints the review data nicely.\n\n2. **`processUserReview()` Function:**\n   - This function demonstrates how to use the `UserReview` class.\n   - It takes the user ID, rating, and comment as input.\n   - It creates a new `UserReview` object using the provided data.\n   - It calls the `displayReview()` method to print the review.\n\n3. **Date Handling:**\n   - The `date('Y-m-d H:i:s')` function is used to get the current date and time in a standard format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).  This is crucial for tracking when the review was submitted.\n\n4. **Encapsulation:**\n   - Using properties and getter methods enforces encapsulation, protecting the data within the `UserReview` object.\n\n5. **Clear Formatting:**  The `displayReview()` method formats the review output for readability.\n\n6. **Comments and Documentation:** The code is well-commented to explain each part.\n\n7. **Database Integration (Placeholder):**  I've included a comment suggesting where you would save the review to a database.  You would need to adapt this part to your database setup (e.g., using PDO or MySQLi).\n\n**How to use this code:**\n\n1.  **Save the Code:** Save the code as a PHP file (e.g., `user_reviews.php`).\n2.  **Run it:**  Run the file from your web server (e.g., using `php user_reviews.php` from the command line, or accessing it through a web browser if your web server is configured to run PHP).\n\n**Next Steps and Further Development:**\n\n* **Database Integration:**  Implement saving the reviews to a database. Use a database library like PDO or MySQLi.  You'll need to:\n    * Create a database table to store the reviews.\n    * Connect to the database.\n    * Create a `saveReview()` function to insert the review data into the table.\n* **Input Validation:** Add input validation to the `processUserReview()` function to ensure that:\n    * The rating is a valid number (e.g., 1-5).\n    * The comment is not empty.\n    * The user ID is a valid integer.  This prevents malicious input.\n* **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling to catch potential exceptions (e.g., database connection errors, invalid input).\n* **Authentication:**  If you're allowing users to submit reviews, you'll need to implement authentication to verify that the user is who they say they are.\n* **User Interface:** Create a web form that allows users to enter their reviews and submit them.\n* **Sorting and Filtering:** Add functionality to sort and filter reviews (e.g., by rating, date, etc.).\n* **Pagination:** If you have a large number of reviews, use pagination to display them in manageable chunks.\n* **Review Moderation:**  Implement a review moderation system to review and approve reviews before they are displayed publicly.\n\nThis detailed response provides a robust and well-structured starting point for your user review system.  Remember to adapt and extend it based on your specific requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n *\n * This class allows you to store and display user reviews for a product or item.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $reviewId;\n    private $userId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes a new UserReview object.\n     *\n     * @param int $reviewId  (Optional)  The unique ID for the review.

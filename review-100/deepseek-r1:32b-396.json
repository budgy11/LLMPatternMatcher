{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, the user asked to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. Probably, they want a function that handles displaying reviews, maybe with some averaging and display of stars.\n\nFirst, I should consider the structure. The function needs to take parameters like total reviews, average rating, and maybe an array of individual ratings. That makes sense because sometimes you might have all the individual data or just the aggregated stats.\n\nI'll start by calculating the star counts. Each star from 1 to 5 will have a count based on how many reviews match that rating. Using a loop for each star seems efficient.\n\nNext, if there are no reviews, I should handle that case gracefully. Maybe return a message indicating no reviews yet.\n\nIf individual ratings are provided, it's better to display them all. Otherwise, just show the average stars and total count. So I'll check if the individual_ratings array is not empty and loop through each rating to build the HTML for each review line.\n\nFor each rating in the individual array, I need to create a div with star spans. Using inline CSS classes like 'star' and maybe 'half' for half ratings would work. Then, display the text rating alongside it.\n\nPutting this together, the function will return the HTML string containing all the stars and reviews. I should make sure the function is flexible enough to handle both cases\u2014when individual ratings are provided or when only average and total are given.\n\nTesting with some examples would help ensure it works correctly. For instance, if there are 5 reviews averaging 4.2, it should display four full stars and one half star. If no reviews exist, it shows the appropriate message.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to handle edge cases like zero reviews or empty individual ratings arrays.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction displayUserReview($total_reviews, $average_rating, $individual_ratings = array()) {\n    // Calculate star distribution\n    $star_counts = array_fill(0, 6, 0); // Indexes 0-5 (0 unused)\n    \n    if (!empty($individual_ratings)) {\n        foreach ($individual_ratings as $rating) {\n            $rounded_rating = round($rating);\n            if ($rounded_rating > 0 && $rounded_rating <= 5) {\n                $star_counts[$rounded_rating]++;\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        // If no individual ratings, calculate based on average\n        $average_rating = round($average_rating, 1);\n        $half_stars = ($average_rating * 2) % 2;\n        \n        for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n            if ($average_rating >= $i) {\n                $star_counts[$i]++;\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Handle case with no reviews\n    if ($total_reviews == 0) {\n        return \"No reviews yet.\";\n    }\n\n    // Build the HTML output\n    $output = \"<div class='review-stats'>\";\n    \n    if (!empty($individual_ratings)) {\n        foreach ($individual_ratings as $rating) {\n            $stars = str_repeat('<span class=\"star full\"></span>', floor($rating));\n            \n            if ($rating % 1 != 0) {\n                $stars .= '<span class=\"star half\"></span>';\n            }\n            \n            $output .= \"<div class='review'>\";\n            $output .= $stars;\n            $output .= \" (<span class='rating-text'>$rating</span>)\";\n            $output .= \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Display average rating\n        for ($i = 1; $i <= $star_counts[5]; $i++) {\n            $output .= '<span class=\"star full\"></span>';\n        }\n\n        if ($average_rating != floor($average_rating)) {\n            $output .= '<span class=\"star half\"></span>';\n        }\n        \n        $output .= \" (<span class='rating-text'>{$average_rating}/5</span>)\";\n    }\n\n    // Add review count\n    $output .= \"<div class='review-count'>\";\n    $output .= \"$total_reviews reviews\";\n    $output .= \"</div>\";\n    \n    $output .= \"</div>\";\n\n    return $output;\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Accepts parameters for total number of reviews, average rating, and an optional array of individual ratings.\n\n2. Calculates star distribution:\n   - If individual ratings are provided, it counts how many times each star level (1-5) appears\n   - If only aggregate data is available, it calculates based on the average rating\n\n3. Handles edge cases like no reviews yet\n\n4. Builds HTML output with stars and review text using CSS classes for styling\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n```php\n$reviews = array(4.5, 5, 3, 2.5, 5);\n$result = displayUserReview(count($reviews), 4.2, $reviews);\n\necho $result;\n```\n\nThe output will be a HTML string that displays the ratings in stars and numerical values.\n\nTo style the output, you would need to add CSS like this:\n\n```css\n.review-stats {\n    font-size: 18px;\n}\n\n.star {\n    display: inline-block;\n    width: 20px;\n    height: 20px;\n    margin-right: 2px;\n}\n\n.full {\n    background-image: url('star-full.png');\n}\n\n.half {\n    background-image: url('star-half.png');\n}\n\n.review-count {\n    color: #666;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    margin-top: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nNote: You would need to replace the star image URLs with actual paths to your star images.\n\nThis function can be customized further by:\n\n1. Adding more detailed error handling\n2. Modifying the HTML structure and CSS classes\n3. Adding filtering or sorting options for individual ratings\n4. Adding support for different rating scales (e.g., 0-10 instead of 1-5)", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction displayUserReview($total_reviews, $average_rating, $individual_ratings = array()) {\n    // Calculate star distribution\n    $star_counts = array_fill(0, 6, 0); // Indexes 0-5 (0 unused)\n    \n    if (!empty($individual_ratings)) {\n        foreach ($individual_ratings as $rating) {\n            $rounded_rating = round($rating);\n            if ($rounded_rating > 0 && $rounded_rating <= 5) {\n                $star_counts[$rounded_rating]++;\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        // If no individual ratings, calculate based on average\n        $average_rating = round($average_rating, 1);\n        $half_stars = ($average_rating * 2) % 2;\n        \n        for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n            if ($average_rating >= $i) {\n                $star_counts[$i]++;\n            } else {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Handle case with no reviews\n    if ($total_reviews == 0) {\n        return \"No reviews yet.\";\n    }\n\n    // Build the HTML output\n    $output = \"<div class='review-stats'>\";\n    \n    if (!empty($individual_ratings)) {\n        foreach ($individual_ratings as $rating) {\n            $stars = str_repeat('<span class=\"star full\"></span>', floor($rating));\n            \n            if ($rating % 1 != 0) {\n                $stars .= '<span class=\"star half\"></span>';\n            }\n            \n            $output .= \"<div class='review'>\";\n            $output .= $stars;\n            $output .= \" (<span class='rating-text'>$rating</span>)\";\n            $output .= \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Display average rating\n        for ($i = 1; $i <= $star_counts[5]; $i++) {\n            $output .= '<span class=\"star full\"></span>';\n        }\n\n        if ($average_rating != floor($average_rating)) {\n            $output .= '<span class=\"star half\"></span>';\n        }\n        \n        $output .= \" (<span class='rating-text'>{$average_rating}/5</span>)\";\n    }\n\n    // Add review count\n    $output .= \"<div class='review-count'>\";\n    $output .= \"$total_reviews reviews\";\n    $output .= \"</div>\";\n    \n    $output .= \"</div>\";\n\n    return $output;\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n$reviews = array(4.5, 5, 3, 2.5, 5);\n$result = displayUserReview(count($reviews), 4.2, $reviews);\n\necho $result;\n```", null]}

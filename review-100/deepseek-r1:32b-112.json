{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, the function needs to take user input for a rating and a comment. So, it'll probably accept these as parameters. But wait, maybe it's better to have an array of review data so it's flexible if more fields are added later.\n\nNext, I need to store these reviews in a database. That means connecting to the database. I should use mysqli or PDO for security against SQL injection. Since the user might not have all the credentials set up, I'll include placeholders for host, user, password, and database name.\n\nI'll start by writing the function with parameters for review data and database credentials. Inside the function, I'll establish a database connection using mysqli_connect. If there's an error connecting, I should throw an exception to handle it properly.\n\nThen, I need to check if the review data is valid. The rating should be between 1 and 5, and the comment shouldn't be empty or just whitespace. Also, sanitizing the input is crucial to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. I'll use mysqli_real_escape_string for escaping special characters.\n\nNow, inserting into the database. I'll write an SQL query that inserts the sanitized rating and comment into a table called 'reviews'. The columns should probably be 'rating' and 'comment'. If the insert fails, throw another exception with the error message.\n\nIf everything goes well, return true to indicate success.\n\nI should also include some example usage so users can see how to call the function. Maybe provide placeholders for their actual database credentials and sample review data.\n\nWait, but using mysqli is somewhat outdated; maybe PDO would be better. However, since the user asked for a simple solution, mysqli might be more straightforward for them. Plus, it's widely used.\n\nI should also consider error handling. The function throws exceptions, so the caller needs to handle them with try-catch blocks. That way, any issues during database operations can be caught and dealt with appropriately.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Function parameters: review data array, db host, user, password, dbname.\n2. Connect to the database using mysqli.\n3. Check for connection errors.\n4. Sanitize rating and comment.\n5. Validate rating range and non-empty comment.\n6. Prepare and execute the SQL insert statement.\n7. Handle any errors during insertion.\n8. Return true on success.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, putting it all together in code.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function for handling user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($review_data, $db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name) {\n    // Extract review data\n    $rating = isset($review_data['rating']) ? intval($review_data['rating']) : 0;\n    $comment = isset($review_data['comment']) ? trim($review_data['comment']) : '';\n\n    // Database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name);\n    \n    if (!$conn) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Database connection failed: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    try {\n        // Sanitize input data\n        $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n        $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n        // Validate rating and comment\n        if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5.\");\n        }\n\n        if (empty($comment)) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Comment cannot be empty.\");\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (rating, comment) VALUES ('$rating', '$comment')\";\n        \n        if (!mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Error inserting review: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n\n        return true;\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Log the error or handle it as needed\n        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n        return false;\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n```php\n$review_data = array(\n    'rating' => 5,\n    'comment' => \"Great product! Highly recommend.\"\n);\n\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_user = 'your_username';\n$db_password = 'your_password';\n$db_name = 'your_database';\n\ntry {\n    if (submit_review($review_data, $db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name)) {\n        echo \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    }\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n}\n```\n\n**Features of this function:**\n\n1. **Input Validation:**\n   - Ensures the rating is between 1 and 5\n   - Checks that the comment is not empty\n\n2. **Sanitization:**\n   - Uses `mysqli_real_escape_string()` to prevent SQL injection\n\n3. **Database Operations:**\n   - Connects to a MySQL database\n   - Inserts review data into a table named 'reviews'\n   - Handles errors gracefully with exceptions\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Throws exceptions for invalid input and database errors\n   - Provides meaningful error messages\n   - Closes the database connection regardless of success or failure (using `finally`)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- Make sure your database table (`reviews`) exists and has the appropriate columns.\n- Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials.\n- You might want to add additional validation or sanitization depending on your specific requirements.\n\n**Security Considerations:**\n\n- Always sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks\n- Use prepared statements (e.g., `mysqli_prepare()`) for better security\n- Never display raw error messages to users in a production environment\n\nYou can modify this function based on your specific needs, such as adding more fields or changing the validation rules.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction submit_review($review_data, $db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name) {\n    // Extract review data\n    $rating = isset($review_data['rating']) ? intval($review_data['rating']) : 0;\n    $comment = isset($review_data['comment']) ? trim($review_data['comment']) : '';\n\n    // Database connection\n    $conn = mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name);\n    \n    if (!$conn) {\n        throw new Exception(\"Database connection failed: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n    }\n\n    try {\n        // Sanitize input data\n        $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n        $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n        // Validate rating and comment\n        if ($rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Rating must be between 1 and 5.\");\n        }\n\n        if (empty($comment)) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Comment cannot be empty.\");\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (rating, comment) VALUES ('$rating', '$comment')\";\n        \n        if (!mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Error inserting review: \" . mysqli_error($conn));\n        }\n\n        return true;\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Log the error or handle it as needed\n        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n        return false;\n    } finally {\n        // Close database connection\n        mysqli_close($conn);\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n$review_data = array(\n    'rating' => 5,\n    'comment' => \"Great product!

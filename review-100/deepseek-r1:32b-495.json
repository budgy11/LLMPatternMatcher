{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what features are essential.\n\nFirst, the function should allow users to submit their reviews. So, it needs fields like username and comment. Maybe also handle ratings if we want stars or something similar in the future.\n\nNext, displaying the reviews is important. I'll need to fetch them from a database and show them on the page. It would be nice to order them by most recent first so users see the latest feedback right away.\n\nHandling duplicate submissions could be an issue. Maybe check if the same user has already submitted a review today or something like that to prevent spamming.\n\nValidation is crucial. We don't want empty comments or invalid data. So, I'll add checks for non-empty username and comment. Also, make sure to sanitize inputs to avoid SQL injection or XSS attacks.\n\nFor database interaction, using prepared statements with mysqli would be secure. That way, the function can insert new reviews without vulnerabilities.\n\nI should also consider displaying each review in a structured HTML format. Maybe wrap each one in divs or article tags with classes for styling later.\n\nError handling is necessary too. If something goes wrong during submission, like database connection issues, the user should get an error message instead of seeing nothing or a blank page.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check if the form is submitted.\n2. Validate username and comment are not empty.\n3. Sanitize inputs to prevent attacks.\n4. Connect to the database using mysqli.\n5. Insert the new review into the reviews table.\n6. After submission, fetch all reviews ordered by date.\n7. Display each review with user details.\n\nI might also include a limit on the number of characters for comments to keep them concise. Maybe add some HTML structure so each review looks nice when rendered.\n\nTesting is important too. I should make sure the function handles various edge cases like empty fields, special characters in usernames, and multiple submissions.\n\nFinally, provide an example usage so others can see how to implement it on their website or application.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP user review system:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction user_review($connection) {\n    // Check if form is submitted\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST' && isset($_POST['submit'])) {\n        $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $_POST['username']);\n        $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $_POST['comment']);\n\n        // Basic validation\n        if (empty($username) || empty($comment)) {\n            echo \"Please fill in all fields!\";\n            exit();\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, comment, date)\n                VALUES ('$username', '$comment', NOW())\";\n        \n        if (!mysqli_query($connection, $sql)) {\n            die('Error submitting review: ' . mysqli_error($connection));\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Display existing reviews\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($connection, $sql);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h4>Review by \" . htmlspecialchars($row['username']) . \"</h4>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . nl2br(htmlspecialchars($row['comment'])) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<small>Posted on: \" . $row['date'] . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews found!\";\n    }\n\n    // Show review submission form\n    echo '<form method=\"post\" action=\"\">\n          <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Your Name\">\n          <textarea name=\"comment\" rows=\"5\" placeholder=\"Write your review...\"></textarea>\n          <button type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n          </form>';\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes:\n\n1. A form for users to submit reviews\n2. Basic input validation\n3. Sanitization of user inputs\n4. Database operations to store and retrieve reviews\n5. Display of existing reviews with timestamps\n\nTo use this function, you'll need to:\n\n1. Create a MySQL database table named `reviews` with the following columns:\n   - id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n   - username (VARCHAR)\n   - comment (TEXT)\n   - date (DATETIME)\n\n2. Connect to your database before calling the function:\n```php\n$connection = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\nif (!$connection) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n```\n\n3. Call the `user_review($connection)` function in your PHP script where you want to display the review system.\n\nFeatures:\n- Users can submit their reviews\n- Reviews are displayed with usernames and timestamps\n- Latest reviews appear first (ordered by date)\n- Basic input validation is included\n- HTML special characters are escaped for security\n\nYou might want to add additional features such as:\n- User authentication system\n- Review editing/deletion capabilities\n- Rating system (stars or numerical ratings)\n- Comment moderation\n- More comprehensive error handling\n- CSS styling for the review interface", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction user_review($connection) {\n    // Check if form is submitted\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST' && isset($_POST['submit'])) {\n        $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $_POST['username']);\n        $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $_POST['comment']);\n\n        // Basic validation\n        if (empty($username) || empty($comment)) {\n            echo \"Please fill in all fields!\";\n            exit();\n        }\n\n        // Insert review into database\n        $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (username, comment, date)\n                VALUES ('$username', '$comment', NOW())\";\n        \n        if (!mysqli_query($connection, $sql)) {\n            die('Error submitting review: ' . mysqli_error($connection));\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Display existing reviews\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10\";\n    $result = mysqli_query($connection, $sql);\n\n    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h4>Review by \" . htmlspecialchars($row['username']) . \"</h4>\";\n            echo \"<p>\" . nl2br(htmlspecialchars($row['comment'])) . \"</p>\";\n            echo \"<small>Posted on: \" . $row['date'] . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews found!\";\n    }\n\n    // Show review submission form\n    echo '<form method=\"post\" action=\"\">\n          <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Your Name\">\n          <textarea name=\"comment\" rows=\"5\" placeholder=\"Write your review...\"></textarea>\n          <button type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\">Submit Review</button>\n          </form>';\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n$connection = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database_name\");\nif (!$connection) {\n    die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\n```"]}

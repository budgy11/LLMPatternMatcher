For a real-world application, you would likely use a database.\n* **Timestamp:**  Adds a timestamp (`date()`) to each review, indicating when it was created. This is very useful for sorting, filtering, and analysis.\n* **`getAllReviews()`:** Provides a function to retrieve all reviews.\n* **`getReviewsByUserId()`:** Allows you to retrieve reviews for a specific user.\n* **`calculateAverageRating()`:**  Calculates the average rating.  Handles the case where there are no reviews to prevent division by zero errors, returning `null` in that case. The use of `round()` provides a cleaner, more user-friendly average rating.\n* **`clearReviews()`:** Function to completely clear the stored reviews. Useful for resetting the system.\n* **Clearer Example Usage:** Provides a detailed example of how to use the `UserReview` class, demonstrating all its functions.\n* **Comments & Docblocks:** Includes detailed comments and docblocks to explain the purpose of each function and the class itself.\n* **Error Handling:** Handles the case where no reviews are available when calculating the average rating (returning `null` instead of throwing an error).\n* **String Typing:** Use `string` type hints for method parameters to help with static analysis and potential type errors.\n* **Return Types:** Uses `bool` and `float|null` return types, which provides more explicit information about the function's results.\n\n**How to improve this for a real-world application:**\n\n1. **Database Integration:**  Instead of using a simple array, use a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to store the reviews. This is essential for scalability and data integrity. Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like Doctrine or Eloquent to simplify database interactions.\n\n2. **More Robust Validation:** Add more validation, such as:\n   * **Comment Length Limits:**  Prevent excessively long comments.\n   * **HTML Sanitization:** If comments allow HTML, sanitize them to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n   * **User Authentication:**  Require users to be logged in before submitting reviews.\n\n3. **Security:**\n   * **SQL Injection Prevention:** Use prepared statements or an ORM to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n   * **XSS Prevention:** Sanitize user input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n4. **User Interface (UI):**  Create a form (HTML/JavaScript) to allow users to submit reviews through a website or web application.\n\n5. **Sorting and Filtering:** Implement sorting (e.g., by date, rating) and filtering (e.g., by rating, user) options.\n\n6. **Pagination:** For a large number of reviews, implement pagination to display them in manageable chunks.\n\n7. **Rating System:** Consider using a more sophisticated rating system, such as a star rating system or a numeric rating with minimum and maximum values.\n\n8. **Review Moderation:** Implement a system for moderating reviews to ensure they are appropriate and comply with your terms of service.\n\n9. **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the `UserReview` class.\n\nThis improved answer provides a solid foundation for building a review system, incorporating best practices for code quality, security, and scalability. Remember to adapt it to your specific requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * Class UserReview\n *\n * This class allows users to submit and view reviews for a product or service.\n */\nclass UserReview\n{\n    private $reviews = [];\n\n    /**\n     * Adds a new review to the system.\n     *\n     * @param string $userId    The ID of the user submitting the review.\n     * @param string $rating    The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment  The user's comment about the product/service.\n     *\n     * @return bool True if the review was added successfully, false otherwise.\n     */\n    public function addReview(string $userId, string $rating, string $comment)\n    {\n        // Validation -  Add more validation as needed (e.g., numeric rating check, comment length limits)\n        if (!is_numeric($rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        $review = [\n            'userId' => $userId,\n            'rating' => $rating,\n            'comment' => $comment,\n            'date' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s') // Timestamp of when the review was added\n        ];\n\n        $this->reviews[] = $review;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves all reviews.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of all reviews.\n     */\n    public function getAllReviews()\n    {\n        return $this->reviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves reviews by user ID.\n     *\n     * @param string $userId The user ID to filter by.\n     *\n     * @return array An array of reviews for the specified user.\n     */\n    public function getReviewsByUserId(string $userId)\n    {\n        $userReviews = [];\n        foreach ($this->reviews as $review) {\n            if ($review['userId'] === $userId) {\n                $userReviews[] = $review;\n            }\n        }\n        return $userReviews;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Calculates the average rating for a product/service.\n     *\n     * @return float|null The average rating, or null if no reviews are available.\n     */\n    public function calculateAverageRating()\n    {\n        if (empty($this->reviews)) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        $totalRating = 0;\n        foreach ($this->reviews as $review) {\n            $totalRating += floatval($review['rating']);\n        }\n        return round($totalRating / count($this->reviews), 2); // Round to 2 decimal places\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Clears all reviews.\n     */\n    public function clearReviews()\n    {\n        $this->reviews = [];\n    }\n}\n\n// --- Example Usage ---\n// Create a UserReview object\n$reviewSystem = new UserReview();\n\n// Add some reviews\n$reviewSystem->addReview('user123', 4, 'Great product!

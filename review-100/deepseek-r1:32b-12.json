{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should handle both submitting and displaying reviews. So, it needs parameters for database connection, product ID, user ID, rating, comment, and whether to display the reviews or just submit them.\n\nI'll start by writing the function with these parameters. If all parameters are provided except displayReviews, then it's a submission. Otherwise, if display is true, it will fetch and show the reviews.\n\nFor submitting a review, I should check if the review already exists for that user and product to avoid duplicates. So, I'll write a query to count existing entries. If none, insert the new review; else, maybe update or return an error.\n\nWhen displaying, I need to fetch all reviews for the given product ID. Then calculate average rating by summing ratings and dividing by count. Also, display each review with user info if possible.\n\nI should include error handling for database queries to catch any issues. Maybe use try-catch blocks or check for errors after executing queries.\n\nFormatting the output is important too. The average rating should be displayed as stars, perhaps using emojis. Each review will show the user's name (or username) and comment, along with their rating stars.\n\nWait, how do I get the user's full name? I'll need to join the users table in the query when fetching reviews. So, during display, I can retrieve both review and user details.\n\nI should also handle cases where the user doesn't have a full name recorded, maybe defaulting to their username or showing a placeholder.\n\nTesting edge cases is crucial. For example, if no reviews exist yet, it should show that there are no reviews available.\n\nAlso, consider SQL injection by using prepared statements or escaping inputs properly. Since I'm using mysqli, perhaps using prepare statements would be better for security.\n\nWait, in the initial code, I used mysqli_query directly. Maybe I should switch to prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. That way, placeholders can handle user inputs safely.\n\nLet me adjust that. For submission, use a prepared statement with placeholders for product_id, user_id, rating, and comment. Similarly, when fetching reviews, prepare the statement to select from reviews and users where product_id matches.\n\nI should also make sure to close database connections properly after use to prevent resource leaks.\n\nAnother thing: if a review is submitted without a comment, it might look odd. Maybe add validation in the function to ensure that comments aren't empty or handle them gracefully.\n\nBut since the function's main purpose is submission and display, perhaps the validation should be handled elsewhere, like on the frontend before calling this function.\n\nAlso, when calculating the average rating, if there are no reviews yet, division by zero could occur. Need to check if review_count is greater than 0 before dividing.\n\nI think I've covered most aspects. Now, putting it all together in code: handle submission first, then display, ensuring proper database interactions and output formatting.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction manageUserReviews($conn, $productId, $userId = null, $rating = null, $comment = null, $displayReviews = false) {\n    // If all parameters are provided except displayReviews, assume we're submitting a review\n    if ($userId !== null && $rating !== null && $comment !== null) {\n        try {\n            // Check if the user has already reviewed this product\n            $checkReviewQuery = \"SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ? AND user_id = ?\";\n            $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $checkReviewQuery);\n            mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"ii\", $productId, $userId);\n            mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n            $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n            $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\n\n            if ($row['count'] == 0) {\n                // Insert the new review\n                $insertReviewQuery = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n                $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $insertReviewQuery);\n                mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"iiis\", $productId, $userId, $rating, $comment);\n                mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n                echo \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n            } else {\n                // Review already exists\n                echo \"You have already submitted a review for this product.\";\n            }\n        } catch (mysqli_sql_exception $e) {\n            echo \"Error: \" . $e->getMessage();\n        }\n    }\n\n    if ($displayReviews) {\n        try {\n            // Get all reviews for the specified product\n            $getReviewsQuery = \"\n                SELECT r.rating, r.comment, u.full_name \n                FROM reviews r \n                LEFT JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id \n                WHERE r.product_id = ?\n                ORDER BY r.review_date DESC\";\n            \n            $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $getReviewsQuery);\n            mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, \"i\", $productId);\n            mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n            $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n\n            // Calculate average rating\n            $averageRating = 0;\n            $reviewCount = 0;\n\n            while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n                $averageRating += $row['rating'];\n                $reviewCount++;\n            }\n\n            if ($reviewCount > 0) {\n                $averageRating /= $reviewCount;\n                // Reset result pointer to display reviews\n                mysqli_data_seek($result, 0);\n            } else {\n                echo \"No reviews available for this product.\";\n                return;\n            }\n\n            // Display average rating\n            echo \"<h3>Average Rating: \" . number_format($averageRating, 1) . \"/5</h3>\";\n            \n            // Display each review\n            while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n                $ratingStars = str_repeat(\"\u2b50\", $row['rating']);\n                $fullName = $row['full_name'] ??

To submit a new review:\n```php\nmanageUserReviews($conn, 1, 5, 4, \"Great product!\");\n```\n2. To display existing reviews:\n```php\nmanageUserReviews($conn, 1, null, null, null, true);\n```\n\nFeatures of this function:\n\n1. Submits new reviews with user ID, rating (1-5), and comment\n2. Checks if the user has already reviewed the product before submitting a new one\n3. Displays all reviews for a product including:\n   - Average rating\n   - User name (if available)\n   - Rating stars\n   - Review comment\n\nNote: You'll need to:\n\n1. Create appropriate database tables (`reviews` and `users`)\n2. Connect your database properly (`$conn` parameter)\n3. Style the output using CSS as needed\n4. Add proper validation for inputs\n5. Handle any potential SQL injection threats with prepared statements (which are used in this example)\n\nTo use this function effectively, you should:\n\n1. Create a form to collect user reviews\n2. Ensure users are authenticated before submitting reviews\n3. Implement proper error handling\n4. Add CAPTCHA or other anti-spam measures if needed\n5. Regularly moderate reviews\n\nRemember to replace placeholder values (like `htmlspecialchars()`) with your actual security measures and data validation as needed for your specific application.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction manageUserReviews($conn, $productId, $userId = null, $rating = null, $comment = null, $displayReviews = false) {\n    // If all parameters are provided except displayReviews, assume we're submitting a review\n    if ($userId !== null && $rating !== null && $comment !== null) {\n        try {\n            // Check if the user has already reviewed this product\n            $checkReviewQuery = \"SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?

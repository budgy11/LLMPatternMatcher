{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants to create a PHP function for handling user reviews. Let me break down what this entails.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different actions a user might take regarding their reviews. They could be adding a new review, editing an existing one, or deleting it. So, the function should handle these three cases.\n\nI'll start by setting up the function parameters. It should accept the review ID, which can be null if adding a new review. Then, the user ID, username, rating, and comment are all necessary. Including a connection to the database is also essential for executing queries.\n\nNext, I need to check if the review ID is provided. If it's not, that means we're adding a new review. I'll insert the user details along with the rating and comment into the reviews table.\n\nIf the review ID is provided, we have two possibilities: editing or deleting. So, I'll include an 'action' parameter to distinguish between these actions. For editing, I'll update the rating and comment where the review ID matches. For deletion, I'll set a deleted flag to true to logically delete the review without permanently removing it from the database.\n\nI should also handle any potential errors during query execution. Using try-catch blocks can help manage exceptions and provide appropriate error messages or logging.\n\nFinally, after successfully executing an insert or update, I'll return a success message indicating whether a new review was added or existing data was updated.\n\nPutting it all together, the function will dynamically decide which operation to perform based on the parameters provided. This makes the function versatile for different user actions related to their reviews.\n</think>\n\nHere's a PHP function that handles user reviews, including adding, editing, and deleting reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction handleUserReview($reviewId = null, $userId, $username, $rating, $comment, $connection) {\n    try {\n        if ($reviewId === null) {\n            // Add new review\n            $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, username, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\");\n            $stmt->bind_param(\"isss\", $userId, $username, $rating, $comment);\n            if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                return \"Review added successfully\";\n            } else {\n                return \"Error adding review: \" . $stmt->error;\n            }\n        } else {\n            // Check if we're updating or deleting\n            $action = $_POST['action'] ?? 'update';\n            \n            if ($action === 'delete') {\n                // Delete review\n                $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"UPDATE reviews SET deleted = 1 WHERE review_id = ?\");\n                $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $reviewId);\n                if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                    return \"Review deleted successfully\";\n                } else {\n                    return \"Error deleting review: \" . $stmt->error;\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Update review\n                $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"UPDATE reviews SET rating = ?, comment = ? WHERE review_id = ?\");\n                $stmt->bind_param(\"isi\", $rating, $comment, $reviewId);\n                if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                    return \"Review updated successfully\";\n                } else {\n                    return \"Error updating review: \" . $stmt->error;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        return \"An error occurred: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Handles both adding new reviews and editing existing ones\n2. Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection\n3. Includes error handling with try-catch blocks\n4. Supports deleting reviews by marking them as deleted (soft delete)\n5. Takes a database connection as a parameter\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. You need to have a database table named `reviews` with the following columns:\n   - review_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)\n   - user_id (INT)\n   - username (VARCHAR)\n   - rating (INT)\n   - comment (TEXT)\n   - deleted (TINYINT)\n\n2. When adding a new review:\n```php\n$result = handleUserReview(\n    null,\n    $userId,\n    $username,\n    $rating,\n    $comment,\n    $connection\n);\n```\n\n3. When editing an existing review:\n```php\n$result = handleUserReview(\n    $reviewId,\n    $userId,\n    $username,\n    $rating,\n    $comment,\n    $connection\n);\n```\n\n4. When deleting a review, set the action parameter to 'delete':\n```php\n// In your form or request, include a hidden input:\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"delete\">\n\n// Then call the function:\n$result = handleUserReview($reviewId, null, null, null, null, $connection);\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to adjust the security measures according to your application's requirements, such as validating user inputs and implementing proper authentication checks before allowing users to edit or delete reviews.\n\nYou can also extend this function by adding:\n\n- Review validation (e.g., ensuring rating is between 1-5)\n- Timestamps for when reviews were created/updated\n- User verification before editing/deleting reviews\n- More detailed error logging\n- Pagination for displaying multiple reviews\n- Search functionality for reviews\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see any of these additional features implemented!", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction handleUserReview($reviewId = null, $userId, $username, $rating, $comment, $connection) {\n    try {\n        if ($reviewId === null) {\n            // Add new review\n            $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, username, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\");\n            $stmt->bind_param(\"isss\", $userId, $username, $rating, $comment);\n            if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                return \"Review added successfully\";\n            } else {\n                return \"Error adding review: \" . $stmt->error;\n            }\n        } else {\n            // Check if we're updating or deleting\n            $action = $_POST['action'] ?? 'update';\n            \n            if ($action === 'delete') {\n                // Delete review\n                $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"UPDATE reviews SET deleted = 1 WHERE review_id = ?\");\n                $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $reviewId);\n                if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                    return \"Review deleted successfully\";\n                } else {\n                    return \"Error deleting review: \" . $stmt->error;\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Update review\n                $stmt = $connection->prepare(\"UPDATE reviews SET rating = ?, comment = ?

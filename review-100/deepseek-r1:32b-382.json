{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, so the user asked to create a user review function using PHP. I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. They probably want a function that allows users to leave reviews on their website. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, I should think about what such a function needs. It should handle saving reviews to a database, displaying them, and maybe even allowing users to edit or delete their own reviews. Oh, and they might also want an average rating display.\n\nI'll start by setting up a basic review submission feature. That means creating a form where users can input their name, email (optional), rating from 1 to 5 stars, and their comment. Then, when the form is submitted, I need to validate the inputs to ensure they're correct before saving them to the database.\n\nNext, displaying the reviews is important. After submitting, the user should see all the reviews, including theirs. So, I'll need a section that fetches all entries from the database and displays them on the page.\n\nRating stars can be shown using emojis, which are simple and easy to implement without extra libraries. Each review will display the star rating based on the submitted value.\n\nI should also include validation checks. For example, making sure the name isn't empty, the email is valid if provided, and the rating is a number between 1 and 5. If any of these checks fail, I'll return an error message.\n\nSecurity is another consideration. I need to prevent SQL injection, so using prepared statements with PDO would be good. Also, sanitizing inputs to avoid XSS attacks by escaping output data when displaying it.\n\nThe database setup is essential. I'll create a table called 'reviews' with columns for review ID, user name, email (nullable), rating, comment, and submission date. Using InnoDB engine and setting the primary key on 'review_id' makes sense.\n\nFor the average rating, I can write a separate function that calculates the average from all reviews in the database. That way, whenever someone views the page, they see the updated average.\n\nI should also handle different scenarios in the form submission. If the form is submitted successfully, display a thank you message and reload the page to show the new review. If there's an error, show it above the form so users can correct their input.\n\nIn the code structure, I'll include the database connection details first. Then, define functions for displaying the average rating and handling the submission. The HTML part will have a form for submitting reviews and a section to display them, using PHP loops to fetch and show each review.\n\nTesting is important too. After writing the code, I should test submitting a review, checking if it appears correctly, verifying that invalid inputs trigger errors, and ensuring that non-logged-in users can't edit or delete others' reviews unless they have the correct ID, which isn't exposed publicly.\n\nI might also consider adding user authentication in the future, but for now, the focus is on basic functionality. Maybe in a later version, allow users to edit or delete their own reviews by adding form fields with hidden IDs and checking if the current user is the one who submitted the review.\n\nOverall, the key points are: setting up the database, creating the submission form, validating inputs, saving to the database, displaying all reviews with stars, calculating average rating, and ensuring security against SQL injection and XSS.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review system using PHP. This code includes functions for submitting reviews, displaying reviews, and calculating average ratings:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Database connection details\n$host = 'localhost';\n$username = 'root';\n$password = '';\n$dbname = 'reviews_db';\n\n// Create database connection\n$conn = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname\", $username, $password);\n$conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n\n// Function to display average rating\nfunction getAverageRating() {\n    global $conn;\n    $stmt = $conn->query(\"SELECT AVG(rating) as average FROM reviews\");\n    $result = $stmt->fetch();\n    return number_format($result['average'], 1);\n}\n\n// Function to handle review submission\nfunction submitReview($name, $email, $rating, $comment) {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    // Validate input\n    if (empty($name) || empty($rating) || empty($comment)) {\n        return \"Please fill in all required fields.\";\n    }\n    \n    if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL) && $email != '') {\n        return \"Invalid email format.\";\n    }\n    \n    if (!ctype_digit((string)$rating) || $rating < 1 || $rating > 5) {\n        return \"Rating must be between 1 and 5 stars.\";\n    }\n    \n    // Sanitize input\n    $name = htmlspecialchars($name);\n    $email = htmlspecialchars($email);\n    $comment = htmlspecialchars($comment);\n    \n    // Insert review into database\n    try {\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (user_name, user_email, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\");\n        $stmt->execute([$name, $email, $rating, $comment]);\n        return \"Review submitted successfully!\";\n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        return \"Error submitting review: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to display reviews\nfunction displayReviews() {\n    global $conn;\n    \n    try {\n        $stmt = $conn->query(\"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY submission_date DESC\");\n        while ($row = $stmt->fetch()) {\n            $rating = $row['rating'];\n            $comment = $row['comment'];\n            $submissionDate = $row['submission_date'];\n            \n            // Display star rating\n            $stars = str_repeat(\"\u2605\", $rating) . str_repeat(\"\u2606\", 5 - $rating);\n            \n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<div class='rating'>$stars</div>\";\n            echo \"<div class='comment'>$comment</div>\";\n            echo \"<div class='date'>Submitted on: $submissionDate</div>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } catch(PDOException $e) {\n        die(\"Error displaying reviews: \" . $e->getMessage());\n    }\n}\n\n// Handle form submission\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    if (isset($_POST['submit_review'])) {\n        $name = $_POST['name'];\n        $email = $_POST['email'];\n        $rating = $_POST['rating'];\n        $comment = $_POST['comment'];\n        \n        $result = submitReview($name, $email, $rating, $comment);\n        if ($result == \"Review submitted successfully!\") {\n            // Reload page to show new review\n            header(\"Location: #\" . md5(uniqid()));\n            exit();\n        } else {\n            echo \"<div class='error'>$result</div>\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis code includes the following features:\n\n1. A form for submitting reviews (name, email, rating, and comment fields)\n2. Validation of user input\n3. Sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks\n4. Display of all submitted reviews with star ratings\n5. Calculation of average rating\n6. Database connection handling\n\nTo use this code:\n\n1. Create a database named 'reviews_db' with the following table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n    review_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    user_email VARCHAR(255),\n    rating TINYINT NOT NULL,\n    comment TEXT NOT NULL,\n    submission_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n) ENGINE=InnoDB;\n```\n\n2. Modify the database connection details in the code to match your environment.\n\n3. Use the following HTML structure to display the review form and reviews:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>User Reviews</title>\n    <style>\n        .rating {\n            font-size: 24px;\n            margin-bottom: 10px;\n        }\n        .review {\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            padding: 15px;\n            margin-bottom: 15px;\n        }\n        .error {\n            color: red;\n            margin-bottom: 15px;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>User Reviews</h1>\n    \n    <!-- Review Form -->\n    <form method=\"post\" action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>\">\n        <div>\n            <label for=\"name\">Name:</label><br>\n            <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required>\n        </div>\n        \n        <div>\n            <label for=\"email\">Email (optional):</label><br>\n            <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n        </div>\n        \n        <div>\n            <label for=\"rating\">Rating:</label><br>\n            <select id=\"rating\" name=\"rating\" required>\n                <option value=\"\">Select rating...</option>\n                <option value=\"1\">1 Star</option>\n                <option value=\"2\">2 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"3\">3 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"4\">4 Stars</option>\n                <option value=\"5\">5 Stars</option>\n            </select>\n        </div>\n        \n        <div>\n            <label for=\"comment\">Comment:</label><br>\n            <textarea id=\"comment\" name=\"comment\" required></textarea>\n        </div>\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit_review\" value=\"Submit Review\">\n    </form>\n\n    <!-- Display Average Rating -->\n    <h3>Average Rating: <?php echo getAverageRating(); ?> Stars</h3>\n\n    <!-- Display All Reviews -->\n    <h2>Reviews:</h2>\n    <?php displayReviews(); ?>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFeatures of this system:\n\n1. Users can submit reviews with ratings from 1 to 5 stars\n2. Reviews are stored in a database and displayed on the page\n3. Average rating is calculated and displayed\n4. Input validation and sanitization are implemented\n5. Star ratings are displayed using emojis (\u2605\u2606)\n6. Reviews include submission date\n\nYou can customize this code further by:\n\n1.

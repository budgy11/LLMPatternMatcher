{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should allow users to leave reviews on a website. So, it needs a form where users can input their name and review. Then, when they submit, the data should be saved somewhere. Maybe in an array since I'm not using a database here.\n\nI'll start by setting up the basic HTML structure with PHP embedded. I'll need a heading, a form with two input fields for name and review, and a submit button. Also, I should display any submitted reviews below the form so users can see previous feedback.\n\nWait, but how do I handle multiple submissions? Oh right, each time the form is submitted, it adds a new review to an array stored in a session or maybe just in memory for this example. Since sessions can complicate things, maybe I'll use a static variable inside a function so it persists across calls without needing cookies.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Create an HTML form with name and review fields.\n2. Use PHP to handle form submission.\n3. Store each review in an array, perhaps using $_SESSION or a static variable.\n4. Display all stored reviews after submission.\n\nWait, but if I use a function, I can't really use global variables easily unless I declare them as such. Alternatively, using static within the function could work to keep the reviews between calls.\n\nI'll structure the code with a function that includes HTML and PHP logic. When the form is submitted, it adds the new review to the array and then displays all reviews.\n\nAlso, I should include some checks: maybe limit the length of the name and review to prevent too much data. Also, handle cases where fields are empty by showing an error message.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the code:\n\n- Start with the function definition.\n- Initialize a static array to hold reviews if it's not already set.\n- Check if the form was submitted (using isset on $_POST).\n- Validate inputs: ensure name and review are provided, maybe trim whitespace.\n- Add the new review as an associative array with 'name' and 'review' keys.\n- Then display all reviews in a list.\n\nI should also include error handling. For example, if either field is empty, show an error message above the form.\n\nTesting edge cases: what if someone submits an empty name or review? The code should catch that and inform the user.\n\nWait, but using $_SESSION would require starting the session with session_start(), which might not be included in all environments. Maybe it's better to use a static variable within the function for simplicity, even though it resets when the server restarts.\n\nAlternatively, if this is just a small example, a static array will suffice without needing external storage.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe function will output the form and handle submission. When submitted, it adds the review to the static array and then loops through the array to display each review in an ordered list.\n\nI should also include some styling to make it look decent, maybe with CSS classes for the container, form, input fields, button, and error messages.\n\nAnother consideration: if using sessions, ensure that the session is started. But since this function is self-contained, starting a session inside might not be ideal. So sticking with static array makes more sense here.\n\nI think I've covered the main points. Now, time to write the code step by step.\n</think>\n\nTo create a user review system using PHP, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up HTML Structure**: Create an HTML form where users can input their name and review.\n2. **Use PHP for Handling Submissions**: Implement PHP logic to process form data when submitted.\n3. **Store Reviews**: Use an array (static or session-based) to store each new review.\n4. **Display Reviews**: After submission, show all stored reviews on the page.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction userReviewForm() {\n    // Initialize static variable to hold reviews across function calls\n    static $reviews = array();\n    \n    // Check if form was submitted\n    if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n        // Validate inputs\n        $name = trim($_POST[\"reviewer_name\"]);\n        $reviewText = trim($_POST[\"review_text\"]);\n        \n        if ($name !== \"\" && $reviewText !== \"\") {\n            // Add new review to the array\n            $reviews[] = array(\n                'name' => $name,\n                'text' => $reviewText\n            );\n            \n            // Optionally reset form fields after submission\n            header(\"Location: \" . $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]);\n            exit();\n        } else {\n            $errorMessage = \"Please enter both your name and review!\";\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Output the HTML form and reviews\n    ?>\n    <div class=\"review-container\">\n        <?php if (isset($errorMessage)) { ?>\n            <p class=\"error\"><?php echo $errorMessage; ?></p>\n        <?php } ?>\n        \n        <h2>Leave a Review</h2>\n        <form method=\"post\" action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]; ?>\">\n            <div class=\"form-group\">\n                <label for=\"reviewer_name\">Name:</label><br>\n                <input type=\"text\" id=\"reviewer_name\" name=\"reviewer_name\" required>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"form-group\">\n                <label for=\"review_text\">Review:</label><br>\n                <textarea id=\"review_text\" name=\"review_text\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"40\" required></textarea>\n            </div>\n            \n            <button type=\"submit\" name=\"submit_review\">Submit Review</button>\n        </form>\n        \n        <?php if (!empty($reviews)) { ?>\n            <h3>Previous Reviews:</h3>\n            <ul class=\"review-list\">\n                <?php foreach ($reviews as $index => $rev) { ?>\n                    <li>\n                        <strong><?php echo htmlspecialchars($rev['name']); ?>:</strong><br>\n                        <?php echo htmlspecialchars($rev['text']); ?>\n                    </li>\n                <?php } ?>\n            </ul>\n        <?php } ?>\n    </div>\n<?php\n}\n\n// Call the function to display the form and handle submissions\nuserReviewForm();\n?>\n```\n\n**Features of This Implementation:**\n\n1. **Static Variable Storage**: Reviews are stored in a static array within the function, preserving data across multiple calls.\n2. **Input Validation**: Ensures both name and review text are provided before storing.\n3. **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if either field is empty.\n4. **HTML Escaping**: Uses `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS attacks by sanitizing output.\n5. **Redirection After Submission**: Automatically redirects to the same page after submission, clearing form fields.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- This example uses a static array for simplicity but doesn't persist data between server restarts or multiple instances. For a production environment, consider using a database like MySQL.\n- To persist reviews across sessions, implement a database connection and store/retrieve reviews from there instead of the static array.\n- Include appropriate CSS styling in your HTML to enhance the appearance.\n\nThis solution provides a basic user review system that can be expanded with additional features such as date/time stamps for each review, user authentication, or rating systems.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction userReviewForm() {\n    // Initialize static variable to hold reviews across function calls\n    static $reviews = array();\n    \n    // Check if form was submitted\n    if ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n        // Validate inputs\n        $name = trim($_POST[\"reviewer_name\"]);\n        $reviewText = trim($_POST[\"review_text\"]);\n        \n        if ($name !== \"\" && $reviewText !== \"\") {\n            // Add new review to the array\n            $reviews[] = array(\n                'name' => $name,\n                'text' => $reviewText\n            );\n            \n            // Optionally reset form fields after submission\n            header(\"Location: \" . $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]);\n            exit();\n        } else {\n            $errorMessage = \"Please enter both your name and review!\";\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Output the HTML form and reviews\n    ?>\n    <div class=\"review-container\">\n        <?php if (isset($errorMessage)) { ?>\n            <p class=\"error\"><?php echo $errorMessage; ?></p>\n        <?php } ?>\n        \n        <h2>Leave a Review</h2>\n        <form method=\"post\" action=\"<?php echo $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"]; ?>\">\n            <div class=\"form-group\">\n                <label for=\"reviewer_name\">Name:</label><br>\n                <input type=\"text\" id=\"reviewer_name\" name=\"reviewer_name\" required>\n            </div>\n            \n            <div class=\"form-group\">\n                <label for=\"review_text\">Review:</label><br>\n                <textarea id=\"review_text\" name=\"review_text\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"40\" required></textarea>\n            </div>\n            \n            <button type=\"submit\" name=\"submit_review\">Submit Review</button>\n        </form>\n        \n        <?php if (!empty($reviews)) { ?>\n            <h3>Previous Reviews:</h3>\n            <ul class=\"review-list\">\n                <?php foreach ($reviews as $index => $rev) { ?>\n                    <li>\n                        <strong><?php echo htmlspecialchars($rev['name']); ?>:</strong><br>\n                        <?php echo htmlspecialchars($rev['text']); ?>\n                    </li>\n                <?php } ?>\n            </ul>\n        <?php } ?>\n    </div>\n<?php\n}\n\n// Call the function to display the form and handle submissions\nuserReviewForm();\n?>\n```"]}

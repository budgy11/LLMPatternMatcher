This is crucial for good object-oriented design.\n   - `__construct()`:  The constructor initializes the review object with the necessary data.  It also automatically sets the current date and time for the review.\n   - `getReviewId()`:  While we generate a unique ID in the constructor, this getter is included for future expansion (e.g., if you need to modify how the IDs are assigned).\n   - `__toString()`:  Provides a human-readable string representation of the review object. This is extremely useful for debugging and displaying reviews in a user-friendly format.\n\n2. **`displayUserReviews()` Function**:\n   - Takes an array of `UserReview` objects as input.\n   - Handles the case where there are no reviews (displays a \"No reviews yet\" message).\n   - Iterates through the array of reviews and displays each one in an unordered list (`<ul>`) format.\n   - Uses the `__toString()` method of the `UserReview` object to generate the review string for display.\n\n3. **Example Usage**:\n   - Creates three `UserReview` objects.\n   - Stores them in an array.\n   - Calls the `displayUserReviews()` function to display the reviews.\n   - Demonstrates the use of the `getCommentLength()` method.\n\n4. **Key Improvements and Best Practices**:\n   - **Encapsulation:** Protects data and enforces good design.\n   - **Error Handling:** (Not explicitly implemented here, but consider adding validation in a real-world application to ensure that ratings are within a valid range (e.g., 1-5), and that comments aren't excessively long).\n   - **Date/Time:**  The `date()` function is used to record the date and time of the review, which is essential for tracking review trends over time.\n   - **`__toString()`**: This is a powerful method that allows you to easily represent your object as a string, which simplifies debugging and display.\n   - **Code Clarity**:  Uses meaningful variable names and comments to make the code easy to understand.\n\n**How to Use it:**\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `reviews.php`).\n2.  **Run it:**  Put the file in your web server's document root and access it through your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/reviews.php`).\n\n**Further Enhancements (for a real-world application):**\n\n*   **Database Integration:**  Store the reviews in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) instead of just in the PHP code. This allows you to scale your application and easily retrieve and display reviews.\n*   **Validation:** Add validation to the constructor to ensure that the data is valid (e.g., rating is within a range, comment isn't too long).\n*   **Unique ID Generation:**  Implement a more robust unique ID generation strategy (e.g., using UUIDs) to avoid collisions.\n*   **User Authentication:**  If you're allowing users to submit reviews, you'll need to implement user authentication to verify that the user is who they say they are.\n*   **Security:**  Sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n*   **Sorting and Filtering:**  Add functionality to sort and filter reviews (e.g., by rating, date, or keyword).\n*   **Pagination:**  If you have a large number of reviews, implement pagination to display them in smaller chunks.\n*   **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload images along with their reviews.\n*   **Review Moderation:**  Implement a system for moderating reviews to prevent inappropriate content.\n*   **Test Cases:**  Write unit tests to verify that the code is working correctly.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n *\n * This class allows you to store and manage user reviews for a product or item.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $reviewId;\n    private $productId;\n    private $userId;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes a new UserReview object.\n     *\n     * @param int $productId The ID of the product being reviewed.\n     * @param int $userId The ID of the user submitting the review.\n     * @param int $rating  The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The user's review comment.\n     */\n    public function __construct($productId, $userId, $rating, $comment) {\n        $this->productId = $productId;\n        $this->userId = $userId;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->date = date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); // Set the current date and time\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Getters and Setters (Encapsulation)\n     */\n\n    public function getReviewId() {\n        return $this->reviewId;\n    }\n\n    public function setReviewId($reviewId) {\n        $this->reviewId = $reviewId;\n    }\n\n    public function getProductId() {\n        return $this->productId;\n    }\n\n    public function getUserId() {\n        return $this->userId;\n    }\n\n    public function getRating() {\n        return $this->rating;\n    }\n\n    public function getComment() {\n        return $this->comment;\n    }\n\n    public function getCommentLength() {\n        return strlen($this->comment);\n    }\n\n\n    public function getDate() {\n        return $this->date;\n    }\n\n\n    /**\n     *  A simple method for representing the review as a string.

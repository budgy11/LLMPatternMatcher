{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a PHP function for user reviews. Let me think about what this function should do.\n\nFirst, it needs to handle the submission of a new review. So, I'll need parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. Maybe optional fields? Or required?\n\nNext, how will this function store the review? Probably in a database. I'll use MySQLi for better security against SQL injection.\n\nI should start by connecting to the database using mysqli_connect(). Make sure to include the correct host, username, password, and database name.\n\nThen, I'll write an INSERT query to add the new review into the reviews table. But wait, I should check if the user has already reviewed this product to prevent multiple submissions. So, a SELECT query first to see if there's an existing entry with the same user_id and product_id.\n\nIf no record exists, proceed with the INSERT. Also, I need to handle any errors that might occur during these database operations.\n\nAfter successfully adding the review, maybe return a success message. If there was an error or if the user already reviewed, return an appropriate message.\n\nI should also consider sanitizing inputs to prevent SQL injection. Using mysqli_real_escape_string() could help with that.\n\nWait, what about prepared statements? They are more secure. Maybe I should use mysqli_prepare() and bind parameters instead of escaping strings manually. That would make the function safer against attacks.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Connect to the database.\n2. Check if a review already exists for this user and product.\n3. If not, insert the new review.\n4. Handle any errors and return messages accordingly.\n\nI'll structure the function with these steps in mind. Also, include error handling using try-catch blocks to manage exceptions gracefully.\n\nFinally, provide an example of how to use the function so users can see a practical implementation.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that allows users to submit reviews for products or services:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to create user review\nfunction createReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'root';\n    $password = '';\n    $database = 'my_store';\n\n    try {\n        // Create database connection\n        $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n        // Check if review already exists for this user and product\n        $checkQuery = \"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ? AND product_id = ?\";\n        $stmt = $conn->prepare($checkQuery);\n        $stmt->bind_param(\"ii\", $userId, $productId);\n        $stmt->execute();\n        $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n        if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n            // Review already exists\n            return \"You have already submitted a review for this product.\";\n        } else {\n            // Insert new review into database\n            $insertQuery = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) \n                           VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\";\n            $stmt = $conn->prepare($insertQuery);\n            $stmt->bind_param(\"iisi\", $userId, $productId, $rating, $comment);\n\n            if ($stmt->execute()) {\n                // Review successfully added\n                return \"Thank you for submitting your review!\";\n            } else {\n                // Error inserting review\n                throw new Exception(\"Error adding review: \" . $conn->error);\n            }\n        }\n\n        $stmt->close();\n        $conn->close();\n\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        // Handle any exceptions\n        return \"An error occurred: \" . $e->getMessage();\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$userId = 1;\n$productId = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$comment = \"Great product, highly recommend!\";\n$result = createReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment);\necho $result;\n\n?>\n```\n\nThis function includes the following features:\n\n1. Creates a connection to a MySQL database\n2. Checks if a review already exists for the given user and product\n3. If no existing review is found, it inserts a new review into the database\n4. Handles errors gracefully using try-catch blocks\n5. Returns appropriate success or error messages\n\nTo use this function:\n\n1. Modify the database connection parameters ($host, $username, etc.) to match your environment\n2. Ensure that your database has a table named 'reviews' with columns:\n   - id (integer, auto-increment)\n   - user_id (integer)\n   - product_id (integer)\n   - rating (integer)\n   - comment (text)\n3. Call the function with valid user ID, product ID, rating (1-5), and comment\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- Make sure to validate and sanitize all input data before using it in queries\n- Add proper error handling for production environments\n- Consider implementing rate limiting or other anti-spam measures\n- You may want to add additional validation checks:\n  - Ensure the rating is a valid integer between 1 and 5\n  - Limit comment length\n  - Validate that the product ID exists\n  - Validate that the user ID exists\n\nYou can also extend this function by adding features like:\n\n- Review editing/deletion capabilities\n- Review upvoting/downvoting system\n- Average rating calculation\n- Review timestamps\n- User verification checks before allowing reviews", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n// Function to create user review\nfunction createReview($userId, $productId, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection parameters\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $username = 'root';\n    $password = '';\n    $database = 'my_store';\n\n    try {\n        // Create database connection\n        $conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $database);\n\n        // Check if review already exists for this user and product\n        $checkQuery = \"SELECT id FROM reviews WHERE user_id = ?

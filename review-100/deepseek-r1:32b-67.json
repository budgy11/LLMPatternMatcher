{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user create a PHP function for a user review system. Let me think about what features are essential.\n\nFirst, the function should handle adding reviews, so it needs parameters like user ID, product ID, rating, and comment. That makes sense because each review is tied to a specific user and product.\n\nNext, I should connect to a database. Using mysqli is good since it's widely supported. I'll need placeholders for the database credentials, which the user will replace with their own info.\n\nSecurity is important, so I'll use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. That way, the user's data is protected from common attacks.\n\nI'll structure the SQL query to insert these values into the reviews table. It's crucial to ensure that all necessary columns are included and that the data types match.\n\nAfter executing the query, checking for errors is a must. If something goes wrong, returning false will help indicate the issue. On success, return true so the user knows it worked.\n\nI should also remind the user about setting up their database correctly, like creating the reviews table with appropriate columns and indexes. Handling edge cases, such as invalid inputs or existing reviews, is important too but might be beyond the basic function's scope.\n\nFinally, providing an example usage helps the user understand how to implement the function in their code. It shows a practical application and makes it easier for them to integrate it into their project.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a PHP function that handles user reviews:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_username = 'username';\n    $db_password = 'password';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new mysqli($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n    // Check for connection errors\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n    // Prepare and execute SQL query\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) \n            VALUES ('$user_id', '$product_id', '$rating', '$comment')\";\n            \n    if ($conn->query($sql)) {\n        // Review added successfully\n        $conn->close();\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        // Error adding review\n        $conn->close();\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n1. Creates a connection to the database\n2. Sanitizes input values to prevent SQL injection\n3. Inserts a new review into the 'reviews' table with user_id, product_id, rating, and comment\n4. Returns true if the review was added successfully, false otherwise\n\nTo use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n```php\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n\nif (add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n    echo \"Thank you for your review!\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error adding review. Please try again.\";\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to:\n\n1. Set the correct database connection details\n2. Create a 'reviews' table in your database with appropriate columns\n3. Add proper error handling as needed\n4. Consider adding validation for the rating (e.g., must be between 1-5)\n5. Sanitize and validate all user inputs\n\nYou might also want to add additional features like:\n\n- Review editing/deletion\n- Retrieving reviews for a product\n- Average rating calculation\n- Review pagination\n- User authentication checks\n- Duplicate review prevention", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $host = 'localhost';\n    $db_username = 'username';\n    $db_password = 'password';\n    $database = 'reviews_db';\n\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new mysqli($host, $db_username, $db_password, $database);\n\n    // Check for connection errors\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection\n    $user_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $user_id);\n    $product_id = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $product_id);\n    $rating = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $rating);\n    $comment = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $comment);\n\n    // Prepare and execute SQL query\n    $sql = \"INSERT INTO reviews (user_id, product_id, rating, comment) \n            VALUES ('$user_id', '$product_id', '$rating', '$comment')\";\n            \n    if ($conn->query($sql)) {\n        // Review added successfully\n        $conn->close();\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        // Error adding review\n        $conn->close();\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n?>\n```", "```php\n// Example usage:\n$user_id = 1;\n$product_id = 5;\n$rating = 4;\n$comment = \"Great product!\";\n\nif (add_review($user_id, $product_id, $rating, $comment)) {\n    echo \"Thank you for your review!\";\n} else {\n    echo \"Error adding review. Please try again.\";\n}\n```"]}

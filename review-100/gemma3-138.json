This promotes reusability and maintainability.\n* **Encapsulation:** Uses getter and setter methods (e.g., `getReviewId()`, `setReviewId()`). This is a critical OOP principle, controlling access to the review's data and ensuring proper validation and data handling.\n* **Constructor:** The `__construct()` method initializes the review object when a new `UserReview` object is created. This is the best place to set initial values.\n* **Date Creation:**  The `date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\")` function creates a timestamp for the date the review was created.  This is much more robust than just using `date()` without a format string.  The `Y-m-d H:i:s` format is a standard and easily sortable format.\n* **`displayReview()` Method:** Provides a clean way to format and display the review information as a string.  This is the method to call when you want to show a review to a user.\n* **`displayUserReviews()` Function:** This function takes an array of `UserReview` objects and iterates through them, calling the `displayReview()` method for each one.  This demonstrates how to collect multiple reviews.\n* **Clear Example Usage:** The code includes a practical example of how to create `UserReview` objects, store them in an array, and then display them.  This makes it easy to understand how to use the class.\n* **String Length Check:** Added a `getCommentLength()` method for basic comment length validation (useful for security/sanitization).\n* **Database Interaction Placeholder:**  The comments indicate where you'd integrate with a database.\n* **Security Considerations (Important - Not Implemented):**  The code *does not* include input validation or sanitization to prevent SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  **You MUST add these measures when you integrate this into a live application.**  This is a critical security aspect.  Techniques include:\n    * **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements with parameterized queries when inserting reviews into a database. This prevents SQL injection.\n    * **Input Validation:**  Validate all user input (e.g., rating must be a number between 1 and 5).\n    * **Output Encoding (for XSS):** Use appropriate output encoding functions (e.g., `htmlspecialchars()`) when displaying user-generated content on your web pages.\n* **Error Handling (Not Included):** For a production application, you'd want to add error handling (try-catch blocks) to gracefully handle potential errors.\n* **Well-Commented:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each part.\n\nHow to Use and Integrate:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**  Create a database table (e.g., `reviews`) with columns like `review_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT), `user_id` (INT), `rating` (INT), `comment` (TEXT), and `date_created` (TIMESTAMP).\n\n2. **Database Connection:**  Establish a connection to your database using a PHP database extension (e.g., MySQLi, PDO).\n\n3. **Insert Reviews:**  When a user submits a review, create a `UserReview` object, and then use database interaction functions to insert the review data into the `reviews` table.\n\n4. **Retrieve Reviews:**  Query the `reviews` table to get the reviews you need to display.\n\n5. **Display Reviews:**  Use the `displayUserReviews()` function to display the reviews to the user.\n\nThis revised response provides a more complete, robust, and secure starting point for your user review system.  Remember to always prioritize security best practices.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Class\n *\n * This class provides a basic system for storing and displaying user reviews.\n */\nclass UserReview {\n\n    private $review_id;\n    private $user_id;\n    private $rating;\n    private $comment;\n    private $date_created;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor\n     *\n     * Initializes a new UserReview object.\n     *\n     * @param int $user_id The ID of the user submitting the review.\n     * @param int $rating The rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5).\n     * @param string $comment The user's review comment.\n     */\n    public function __construct($user_id, $rating, $comment) {\n        $this->review_id = null; // Will be assigned by the database\n        $this->user_id = $user_id;\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n        $this->date_created = date(\"Y-m-d H:i:s\"); // Current timestamp\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Getters and Setters (for encapsulation)\n     */\n\n    public function getReviewId() {\n        return $this->review_id;\n    }\n\n    public function setReviewId($review_id) {\n        $this->review_id = $review_id;\n    }\n\n    public function getUserID() {\n        return $this->user_id;\n    }\n\n    public function getRating() {\n        return $this->rating;\n    }\n\n    public function getComment() {\n        return $this->comment;\n    }\n\n    public function getCommentLength() {\n        return strlen($this->comment);\n    }\n\n    public function setRating($rating) {\n        $this->rating = $rating;\n    }\n\n    public function setComment($comment) {\n        $this->comment = $comment;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Display the review as a formatted string.\n     *\n     * @return string The formatted review string.\n     */\n    public function displayReview() {\n        return \"Review ID: \" . $this->getReviewId() .\n               \"\\nUser ID: \" . $this->getUserID() .\n               \"\\nRating: \" . $this->getRating() .\n               \"\\nComment: \" . $this->getComment() .\n               \"\\nDate Created: \" . $this->date_created;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n/**\n * User Review Review Function - Example Usage\n */\n\nfunction displayUserReviews($reviews) {\n    echo \"<h2>User Reviews</h2>\";\n    echo \"<ul>\";\n    foreach ($reviews as $review) {\n        echo \"<li>\" . $review->displayReview() . \"</li>\";\n    }\n    echo \"</ul>\";\n}\n\n\n// Example Usage:\n\n// Create some review objects\n$review1 = new UserReview(123, 5, \"Great product!

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function should handle both submitting reviews and displaying them. So, maybe I'll start by setting up the HTML form for users to submit their reviews. The form needs fields for the title, content, and rating. I'll include a dropdown for the rating with options from 1 to 5 stars.\n\nNext, I need to process the form submission. When the user submits the review, I should handle it on the same page using PHP. So, I'll check if the form has been submitted by looking for POST data. If it's submitted, I'll retrieve the values and save them into a file or a database.\n\nWait, but saving to a file might be easier for now since setting up a database could complicate things. However, in a real-world scenario, a database would be better for scalability. But for this example, using a file might be simpler. I'll go with that unless specified otherwise.\n\nI should also include validation to ensure all required fields are filled out and the rating is selected correctly. So, I'll add checks for the title, content, and rating. If any of these are missing or invalid, I'll display an error message back to the user.\n\nAfter saving the review, I want to redirect the user so they don't resubmit the same data if they refresh the page. Using header('Location: ...') should work for that.\n\nNow, for displaying the reviews, I'll need to read from the storage (file or database) and output each review. Each displayed review should show the title, author's name (maybe just username), rating as stars, content, and date. I'll format the rating with emojis for simplicity.\n\nI should also calculate the average rating based on all submitted reviews and display it prominently at the top. This will give users a quick overview of the product or service's overall rating.\n\nPutting it all together, the PHP script will first handle form submission, validate data, save to storage, redirect, then proceed to display existing reviews. The HTML part includes the review form and the section where saved reviews are shown.\n\nI think I should also consider security aspects, like preventing SQL injection if using a database or sanitizing inputs if saving to a file. But for this example, maybe basic validation is enough.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the code with clear sections: handling submission, displaying average rating, and showing all reviews. The HTML form will be included at the end so users can submit new reviews after seeing existing ones.\n\nI should test each part as I go: make sure the form submits correctly, data is saved properly, and reviews are displayed without issues. Also, check that the redirect works and prevents duplicate submissions.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP that allows users to submit reviews and displays them:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Review handling function\nfunction handle_reviews() {\n    // Check if form was submitted\n    if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n        $title = $_POST['review_title'];\n        $content = $_POST['review_content'];\n        $rating = $_POST['review_rating'];\n\n        // Validate input\n        if (empty($title) || empty($content) || empty($rating)) {\n            echo \"Please fill in all required fields.\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Save review to a file or database here\n        // For this example, we'll save it to an array in a text file\n\n        $reviews_file = 'reviews.txt';\n        $review_data = [\n            'title' => $title,\n            'content' => $content,\n            'rating' => $rating,\n            'author' => $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] ??

PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND);\n\n        // Redirect after submission\n        header('Location: ' . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);\n        exit();\n    }\n\n    // Display existing reviews\n    $reviews_file = 'reviews.txt';\n    $average_rating = 0;\n    $total_reviews = 0;\n\n    if (file_exists($reviews_file) && filesize($reviews_file) > 0) {\n        $reviews = file($reviews_file);\n        foreach ($reviews as $review_line) {\n            $review = unserialize($review_line);\n            if (!empty($review)) {\n                // Calculate average rating\n                $average_rating += $review['rating'];\n                $total_reviews++;\n            }\n        }\n        $average_rating /= $total_reviews;\n    }\n\n    // Display reviews\n    echo \"<div class='reviews'>\";\n    echo \"<h2>Product Reviews</h2>\";\n    \n    if ($total_reviews > 0) {\n        echo \"<p>Average Rating: \" . number_format($average_rating, 1) . \"/5</p>\";\n        foreach ($reviews as $review_line) {\n            $review = unserialize($review_line);\n            if (!empty($review)) {\n                echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n                echo \"<h3>\" . htmlspecialchars($review['title']) . \"</h3>\";\n                echo \"<p>By \" . htmlspecialchars($review['author']) . \" on \" . $review['date'] . \"</p>\";\n                echo \"<div class='rating'>\";\n                for ($i = 1; $i <= $review['rating']; $i++) {\n                    echo \"\u2b50\";\n                }\n                for ($i = $review['rating'] + 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n                    echo \"\u2b1c\";\n                }\n                echo \"</div>\";\n                echo \"<p>\" . htmlspecialchars($review['content']) . \"</p>\";\n                echo \"</div>\";\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"<p>No reviews yet.

{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "**User Review Function in PHP**\n=====================================\n\nThis is an example of how to create a simple user review system in PHP. This system will allow users to submit reviews for products, and also display the average rating and number of reviews.\n\n**Database Schema**\n-------------------\n\nFor this example, we'll assume you have a database with the following tables:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE products (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  name VARCHAR(255),\n  description TEXT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE reviews (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  product_id INT,\n  user_id INT,\n  rating TINYINT,\n  review_text TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n**PHP Code**\n------------\n\n```php\n// Connect to the database\n$mysqli = new mysqli(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\nfunction get_product_reviews($product_id) {\n  global $mysqli;\n  \n  // Get reviews for this product\n  $query = \"SELECT r.id, r.rating, r.review_text FROM reviews r JOIN products p ON r.product_id = p.id WHERE p.id = '$product_id'\";\n  $result = $mysqli->query($query);\n  \n  // Initialize variables to store the average rating and number of reviews\n  $total_rating = 0;\n  $num_reviews = 0;\n  \n  while ($review = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    $total_rating += $review['rating'];\n    $num_reviews++;\n  }\n  \n  if ($num_reviews > 0) {\n    // Calculate the average rating\n    $average_rating = round($total_rating / $num_reviews, 2);\n  } else {\n    $average_rating = 0;\n  }\n  \n  return array(\n    'reviews' => $result->fetch_all(),\n    'average_rating' => $average_rating,\n    'num_reviews' => $num_reviews\n  );\n}\n\nfunction submit_review($product_id, $rating, $review_text) {\n  global $mysqli;\n  \n  // Insert the review into the database\n  $query = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, review_text) VALUES ('$product_id', '$user_id', '$rating', '$review_text')\";\n  $mysqli->query($query);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$product_id = 1;\n$reviews = get_product_reviews($product_id);\necho \"Product ID: $product_id\\n\";\necho \"Reviews:\\n\";\nprint_r($reviews['reviews']);\necho \"Average Rating: \" . $reviews['average_rating'] . \"\\n\";\necho \"Number of Reviews: \" . $reviews['num_reviews'] . \"\\n\";\n\n// Submit a review\n$rating = 5;\n$review_text = \"This product is amazing!\";\nsubmit_review(1, $rating, $review_text);\n```\n\n**Note:** This is a very basic example and does not include any error checking or security measures that you should implement in a real-world application.\n\nAlso, this code assumes that the `user_id` variable is set elsewhere in your application. You will need to modify the code to match your specific use case.\n\nThis is just an example of how you can create a user review system in PHP. You may want to add additional features such as user authentication, product categories, and more.", "code_blocks": [null, "```php\n// Connect to the database\n$mysqli = new mysqli(\"localhost\", \"username\", \"password\", \"database\");\n\nfunction get_product_reviews($product_id) {\n  global $mysqli;\n  \n  // Get reviews for this product\n  $query = \"SELECT r.id, r.rating, r.review_text FROM reviews r JOIN products p ON r.product_id = p.id WHERE p.id = '$product_id'\";\n  $result = $mysqli->query($query);\n  \n  // Initialize variables to store the average rating and number of reviews\n  $total_rating = 0;\n  $num_reviews = 0;\n  \n  while ($review = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    $total_rating += $review['rating'];\n    $num_reviews++;\n  }\n  \n  if ($num_reviews > 0) {\n    // Calculate the average rating\n    $average_rating = round($total_rating / $num_reviews, 2);\n  } else {\n    $average_rating = 0;\n  }\n  \n  return array(\n    'reviews' => $result->fetch_all(),\n    'average_rating' => $average_rating,\n    'num_reviews' => $num_reviews\n  );\n}\n\nfunction submit_review($product_id, $rating, $review_text) {\n  global $mysqli;\n  \n  // Insert the review into the database\n  $query = \"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, review_text) VALUES ('$product_id', '$user_id', '$rating', '$review_text')\";\n  $mysqli->query($query);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$product_id = 1;\n$reviews = get_product_reviews($product_id);\necho \"Product ID: $product_id\\n\";\necho \"Reviews:\\n\";\nprint_r($reviews['reviews']);\necho \"Average Rating: \" . $reviews['average_rating'] . \"\\n\";\necho \"Number of Reviews: \" . $reviews['num_reviews'] . \"\\n\";\n\n// Submit a review\n$rating = 5;\n$review_text = \"This product is amazing!\";\nsubmit_review(1, $rating, $review_text);\n```"]}

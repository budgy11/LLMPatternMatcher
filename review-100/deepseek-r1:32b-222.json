{"prompt": "Create a user review function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user review function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function needs to display reviews based on a product ID. So, it should take the product ID as an input parameter.\n\nI'll start by setting up a database connection because the reviews are probably stored in a MySQL database. I'll use mysqli for that since it's more secure and efficient than the older mysql functions.\n\nNext, I need to write an SQL query to fetch all reviews associated with the given product ID. The table should have columns like review_id, user_name, rating, comment, and timestamp.\n\nAfter fetching the results, I should loop through each row and extract the necessary data: username, star rating, comment, and the date.\n\nFor displaying the stars, I can use Font Awesome icons. Each star will be an anchor tag with appropriate classes based on whether it's filled or not. If the rating is 5, all five stars are solid; if it's 3, three are solid and two are empty, and so on.\n\nThe review content should include each user's name, their star rating display, their comment, and the date they submitted the review. I'll format the date to be more readable using PHP's date function.\n\nI also need to handle cases where there are no reviews for a product. So, if the query returns zero results, I'll display a message indicating that there are no reviews yet.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the function will connect to the database, run the query, check for results, and then generate the HTML structure with each review inside a div. Each review will have a clean layout, perhaps using Bootstrap classes for styling consistency.\n\nI should make sure to close the database connection after fetching the results to prevent any resource leaks.\n\nFinally, I'll test the function by calling it with a specific product ID and ensure that it correctly displays all relevant reviews or handles the no-review scenario properly.\n</think>\n\nHere's an example of a user review function in PHP. This function will display reviews for a specific product based on its `product_id`.\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction displayUserReviews($product_id) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $servername = \"localhost\";\n    $username = \"username\";\n    $password = \"password\";\n    $dbname = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    // SQL query to get reviews for the product\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?\";\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $product_id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        // Output the review content\n        while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            $username = $row['user_name'];\n            $rating = $row['rating'];\n            $comment = $row['comment'];\n            $date = $row['timestamp'];\n\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>Reviewed by: \" . $username . \"</h3>\";\n            \n            // Display stars\n            echo \"<div class='stars'>\";\n            for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n                if ($i <= $rating) {\n                    echo \"<i class='fas fa-star'></i>\";\n                } else {\n                    echo \"<i class='far fa-star'></i>\";\n                }\n            }\n            echo \"</div>\";\n            \n            // Display comment\n            echo \"<p>\" . $comment . \"</p>\";\n            \n            // Display date\n            echo \"<small>Reviewed on: \" . date('F j, Y', strtotime($date)) . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews found for this product.\";\n    }\n\n    // Close database connection\n    $conn->close();\n}\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Database Connection**:\n   - The function connects to a MySQL database using `mysqli`.\n   - Replace the database credentials (`$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, `$dbname`) with your actual database details.\n\n2. **SQL Query**:\n   - Uses prepared statements for security against SQL injection.\n   - Retrieves all reviews associated with the given `product_id`.\n\n3. **Display Reviews**:\n   - If there are reviews, it loops through each review and displays:\n     - Reviewer's name\n     - Star rating (using Font Awesome icons)\n     - Comment/Review content\n     - Date of review\n\n4. **Star Rating Display**:\n   - Uses `fas fa-star` for filled stars and `far fa-star` for empty stars.\n   - Make sure to include Font Awesome CSS in your project for the star icons to work.\n\n5. **No Reviews Message**:\n   - If no reviews are found for the product, it displays a \"No reviews found\" message.\n\n### How to Use:\n\n1. Include Font Awesome in your HTML file:\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.4/css/all.min.css\">\n```\n\n2. Call the function with a specific product ID:\n```php\n<?php displayUserReviews(1); ?>\n```\n\n3. Customize the styling by adding CSS classes to match your website's design.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Make sure to adjust the database credentials and table structure according to your actual database setup.\n- You might want to add more features like:\n  - Average rating calculation\n  - Review validation\n  - Sorting reviews (newest first/oldest first)\n  - Pagination for large numbers of reviews\n\nThis is a basic implementation that you can extend based on your specific needs.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\nfunction displayUserReviews($product_id) {\n    // Database connection details\n    $servername = \"localhost\";\n    $username = \"username\";\n    $password = \"password\";\n    $dbname = \"reviews_db\";\n\n    // Create database connection\n    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n\n    // Check connection\n    if ($conn->connect_error) {\n        die(\"Connection failed: \" . $conn->connect_error);\n    }\n\n    // SQL query to get reviews for the product\n    $sql = \"SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE product_id = ?\";\n    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);\n    $stmt->bind_param(\"i\", $product_id);\n    $stmt->execute();\n    $result = $stmt->get_result();\n\n    if ($result->num_rows > 0) {\n        // Output the review content\n        while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n            $username = $row['user_name'];\n            $rating = $row['rating'];\n            $comment = $row['comment'];\n            $date = $row['timestamp'];\n\n            echo \"<div class='review'>\";\n            echo \"<h3>Reviewed by: \" . $username . \"</h3>\";\n            \n            // Display stars\n            echo \"<div class='stars'>\";\n            for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {\n                if ($i <= $rating) {\n                    echo \"<i class='fas fa-star'></i>\";\n                } else {\n                    echo \"<i class='far fa-star'></i>\";\n                }\n            }\n            echo \"</div>\";\n            \n            // Display comment\n            echo \"<p>\" . $comment . \"</p>\";\n            \n            // Display date\n            echo \"<small>Reviewed on: \" . date('F j, Y', strtotime($date)) . \"</small>\";\n            echo \"</div>\";\n        }\n    } else {\n        echo \"No reviews found for this product.\";\n    }\n\n    // Close database connection\n    $conn->close();\n}\n?>\n```", null, "```php\n<?php displayUserReviews(1); ?>\n```"]}

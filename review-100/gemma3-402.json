This tells PHP what data type to expect for each parameter, which can help catch errors early.\n* **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block properly handles PDO exceptions. This is *crucial* for database operations.  It catches errors that might occur during the database connection or query execution.\n    * `error_log()`:  Instead of just `echo`ing errors, the `error_log()` function sends error messages to your server's error log. This is a much better practice for debugging and monitoring your application.  This is especially important in production environments.\n* **Prepared Statements:** The code uses prepared statements with `bindParam()`. This is **essential** for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities. Prepared statements separate the SQL query from the data, so the data is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.\n* **PDO:** Uses PDO (PHP Data Objects), which is the recommended way to interact with databases in PHP. PDO provides a consistent interface for working with different database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).\n* **UTF-8 Character Set:**  `charset=utf8` is added to the PDO connection string to support UTF-8 characters, which allows you to store reviews with special characters (e.g., emojis, accented letters).\n* **Clear Comments:** Includes comprehensive comments to explain the code's functionality.\n* **Example Usage:**  Includes an example of how to use the `add_user_review()` function.  This makes it easier to understand how to integrate the function into your application.\n* **Illustrative `get_product_reviews()` function:**  Provides a placeholder function to show you how you might *retrieve* reviews.  The implementation is commented out because it requires a `SELECT` query, which is outside the scope of the `add_user_review` function.\n* **Boolean Return Value:** The function returns `true` on success and `false` on failure, making it easier to check if the review was added correctly.\n\nHow to Use:\n\n1. **Database Setup:**\n   - Create a database (e.g., `your_database_name`).\n   - Create a table named `reviews` with the following columns:\n     - `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)\n     - `product_id` (INT)\n     - `user_id` (INT)\n     - `rating` (INT)\n     - `review_text` (TEXT)\n\n   Example SQL to create the table:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE reviews (\n       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n       product_id INT,\n       user_id INT,\n       rating INT,\n       review_text TEXT\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. **Database Credentials:**  Replace the placeholder values in the code (`$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, `$db_password`) with your actual database credentials.\n\n3. **Run the Code:**  Run the PHP code. It will attempt to add a review to the database.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n* **Security:**  *Always* sanitize and validate user input to prevent SQL injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. The `bindParam()` calls within PDO handle this, but it's still a good practice to validate the data.\n* **Data Validation:** You should also add validation to the `rating` and `review_text` to ensure they meet your requirements (e.g., rating between 1 and 5, review text length limits).\n* **Error Logging:**  Implement more robust error logging.  Instead of just `error_log()`, consider using a logging library.\n* **Scalability:** For high-traffic applications, you might need to use a database connection pool or other techniques to optimize database performance.\n* **Data Persistence:**  This code adds reviews to a database. You'll need a way to display these reviews on your website or application.  You'll likely need to implement a `SELECT` query to retrieve the reviews.\n* **User Authentication:** This example assumes you have a user authentication system in place to get the `user_id`.\n\nThis improved answer provides a robust and secure solution for adding user reviews to a database, along with important considerations for building a production-ready application. Remember to tailor it to your specific needs and security requirements.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * User Review Function\n *\n * This function takes a product ID, a user ID, a rating (1-5), and a review text, \n * and adds a new review to a database table.\n *\n * @param int    $product_id   The ID of the product being reviewed.\n * @param int    $user_id      The ID of the user submitting the review.\n * @param int    $rating       The rating given by the user (1-5).\n * @param string $review_text  The text of the review.\n * @return bool   True if the review was successfully added, false otherwise.\n */\nfunction add_user_review(int $product_id, int $user_id, int $rating, string $review_text): bool\n{\n    // Database connection details (replace with your actual values)\n    $db_host = 'localhost';\n    $db_name = 'your_database_name';\n    $db_user = 'your_database_user';\n    $db_password = 'your_database_password';\n\n    try {\n        // Connect to the database\n        $pdo = new PDO(\"mysql:host=$db_host;dbname=$db_name;charset=utf8\", $db_user, $db_password);\n\n        // Set PDO error mode to exception\n        $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n\n        // Prepare the SQL statement\n        $stmt = $pdo->prepare(\"INSERT INTO reviews (product_id, user_id, rating, review_text) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)\");\n\n        // Bind parameters to the statement\n        $stmt->bindParam(1, $product_id);\n        $stmt->bindParam(2, $user_id);\n        $stmt->bindParam(3, $rating);\n        $stmt->bindParam(4, $review_text);\n\n        // Execute the statement\n        $stmt->execute();\n\n        // Return true if successful\n        return true;\n\n    } catch (PDOException $e) {\n        // Handle database errors\n        error_log(\"Database error: \" . $e->getMessage()); // Log the error\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n\n/**\n *  Example Usage (Demonstration - not part of the core function)\n */\n\n// Example product ID\n$product_id = 123;\n\n// Example user ID (replace with an actual user ID)\n$user_id = 456;\n\n// Example rating\n$rating = 5;\n\n// Example review text\n$review_text = \"This product is amazing!

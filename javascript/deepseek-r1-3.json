Prompts the user to enter their email address\n2. Retrieves stored credentials from localStorage\n3. Searches for a matching email\n4. Displays the corresponding password if found\n5. Provides an option to delete the session cookie (though note: simply clearing localStorage might not be sufficient in all cases)\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Doesn't implement two-factor authentication (MFA)\n- Uses local storage which is cleared on page reload or when the browser is closed\n- No validation against existing sessions\n- Basic security measures are insufficient for production use\n\nTo enhance security, consider:\n\n1. Implementing a secure backend server to store credentials\n2. Adding encryption for credentials transfer between client and server\n3. Using HTTPS\n4. Implementing MFA\n5. Securely clearing tokens and cookies on logout\n6. Input validation of email addresses\n7. Proper error handling\n\nFor a production environment, you'd need to:\n\n- Use a proper authentication service like OAuth or MFA provider\n- Encrypt sensitive data in transit\n- Store passwords securely\n- Implement proper session management", "code_blocks": [null]}

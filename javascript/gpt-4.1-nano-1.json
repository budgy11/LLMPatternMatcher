{"prompt": "Create a session cookie using javascript", "llm_output": "You can create a session cookie in JavaScript by setting a cookie without an expiration date, which makes it a session cookie (it will be deleted when the browser is closed). Here\u2019s an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Function to create a session cookie\nfunction createSessionCookie(name, value) {\n  document.cookie = `${name}=${value}; path=/`;\n}\n\n// Usage\ncreateSessionCookie('mySessionCookie', 'someValue');\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The cookie is set with the `name` and `value`.\n- Omitting the `expires` or `max-age` attribute makes it a session cookie.\n- Setting `path=/` makes the cookie accessible across the entire domain.\n\n**Note:** Make sure you call this on the client side (e.g., after the page loads or upon some event). Also, consider security attributes like `Secure` and `HttpOnly` depending on your needs. For example, for secure cookies:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.cookie = `${name}=${value}; path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax`;\n```\n\nLet me know if you'd like an example including security options!", "code_blocks": [null, null]}

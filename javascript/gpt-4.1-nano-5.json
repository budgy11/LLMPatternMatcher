{"prompt": "Create a file upload function for PDFs using javascript", "llm_output": "Certainly! To create a file upload functionality for PDFs using JavaScript, you'll typically want a simple HTML form with a file input, and some JavaScript to handle the file selection, validation, and potentially uploading the file to a server.\n\nHere\u2019s a basic example that demonstrates how to select a PDF file, validate that it's a PDF, and then prepare it for uploading (for example, via Fetch API). If you'd like to upload to a server, you'd need to have a server endpoint to handle the file upload.\n\n### Example: PDF File Upload with JavaScript\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n  <title>PDF File Upload</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h2>Upload a PDF</h2>\n  <input type=\"file\" id=\"pdfUpload\" accept=\"application/pdf\" />\n  <button id=\"uploadBtn\">Upload</button>\n  <p id=\"status\"></p>\n\n  <script>\n    const uploadInput = document.getElementById('pdfUpload');\n    const uploadBtn = document.getElementById('uploadBtn');\n    const statusText = document.getElementById('status');\n\n    uploadBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {\n      const file = uploadInput.files[0];\n\n      // Basic validation\n      if (!file) {\n        statusText.textContent = 'Please select a file.';\n        return;\n      }\n\n      if (file.type !== 'application/pdf') {\n        statusText.textContent = 'Please select a valid PDF file.';\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Prepare to upload\n      const formData = new FormData();\n      formData.append('file', file);\n\n      // Replace with your server upload URL\n      const uploadUrl = '/upload';\n\n      fetch(uploadUrl, {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: formData\n      })\n      .then(response => response.json()) // Assuming server responds with JSON\n      .then(data => {\n        statusText.textContent = 'Upload successful!';\n        console.log('Server response:', data);\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        statusText.textContent = 'Upload failed.';\n        console.error('Error:', error);\n      });\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- The `<input>` accepts only PDFs via `accept=\"application/pdf\"`.\n- When you click the \"Upload\" button, it checks if a file is selected and if it's a PDF.\n- If valid, it creates a `FormData` object, appends the file, and sends it via `fetch()` to your server endpoint (`/upload`).\n- You should replace `/upload` with the actual URL of your server-side upload handler.\n\n### **Server-side handling**\nTo complete this, you'd need a server that accepts file uploads and processes them accordingly. If you'd like, I can help with example server code (e.g., in Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.).\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more detailed example with server-side code!", "code_blocks": [null]}

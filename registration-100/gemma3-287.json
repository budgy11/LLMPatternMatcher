You'll need to ensure you have the `mysqli` extension enabled in your PHP installation.\n* **Error Handling:** Includes a check for database connection errors and provides a more informative error message.  Crucially, it checks the `query()` result to see if the SQL query was executed successfully.\n* **Password Hashing:**  **Extremely important!**  Uses `password_hash()` to securely hash the password before storing it in the database. *Never* store passwords in plain text.  `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` uses the strongest hashing algorithm available on the system, ensuring better security.  If you use an older version of PHP, you might need to explicitly specify a hashing algorithm (e.g., `PASSWORD_ARGON2_ID`).\n* **Input Sanitization:** Uses `mysqli_real_escape_string()` to properly escape data before inserting it into the database.  This prevents SQL injection attacks.  While `mysqli_real_escape_string` *should* be used, there are newer recommended methods like PDO.  This is a common and still useful technique.\n* **Clearer Code Structure:**  Organized the code into a function (`registerUser`) for better reusability and readability.\n* **Return Values:**  The `registerUser` function now returns `true` on success and `false` on failure. This allows you to check the result and display appropriate feedback to the user.\n* **Comments:**  Added detailed comments to explain each step of the process.\n* **Example Usage:** Included a complete example of how to use the `registerUser` function.  This makes it easier to test and understand the code.\n* **Security Considerations:**  **This is a basic example.**  In a real-world application, you should add further security measures, such as:\n    * **Input Validation:**  Validate the username, password, and email to ensure they meet certain criteria (e.g., length, format).\n    * **Rate Limiting:** Prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of registration attempts.\n    * **CAPTCHA:**  Use a CAPTCHA to prevent automated registration.\n    * **Email Verification:** Send a verification email to the user to confirm their email address.\n* **Database Setup (Important - Not included in the code):**\n  *  You need a database created (e.g., using phpMyAdmin or a command-line tool like `mysql`).\n  *  You need to create a table named `users` with columns for `id`, `username`, `password`, and `email`.  Here's an example SQL query to create the table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL\n);\n```\n\nHow to use this code:\n\n1.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.php` file (e.g., `register.php`).\n2.  **Replace placeholders:**  Replace the database credentials (`$db_host`, `$db_name`, `$db_user`, `$db_pass`) with your actual database information.\n3.  **Create the database and table:**  Make sure you have a database created and the `users` table as described above.\n4.  **Run the script:**  Access the `register.php` file through your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/register.php`).  You'll likely see a message indicating whether the registration was successful.  If you get a \"Connection failed\" error, double-check your database credentials and that your database server is running.\n5.  **Implement a Form:**  The example shows hardcoded data. In a real application, you'll create an HTML form where the user enters their username, password, and email, and then you would call the `registerUser` function to handle the registration.\n\nThis revised response provides a much more robust and secure user registration function, along with detailed explanations and instructions.  It's also a solid starting point for building a more complete registration system. Remember to adapt the database setup and the form integration to your specific needs.\n", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\n// Database Configuration (Replace with your actual database credentials)\n$db_host = \"localhost\";\n$db_name = \"your_database_name\";\n$db_user = \"your_db_user\";\n$db_pass = \"your_db_password\";\n\n// --- Registration Function ---\nfunction registerUser($username, $password, $email) {\n  // 1.

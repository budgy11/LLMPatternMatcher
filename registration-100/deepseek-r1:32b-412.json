{"prompt": "Create a user registration function using php", "llm_output": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a user registration function using PHP. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the essential fields required for registration. Typically, users need to provide their name, email, and password. So, I'll include inputs for full name, email, and password in the form.\n\nNext, I need to handle form submission. When the user submits the form, I'll have to process the data on the server side using PHP. That means checking if the form was submitted and then validating each input field.\n\nValidation is crucial. For the full name, I should ensure it's not empty and contains only letters and spaces. Using a regular expression would be a good approach here. For the email, I'll check that it's in a valid format using PHP's built-in filter_var function with FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL. The password needs to meet certain criteria, like being at least 8 characters long, containing both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Again, a regular expression can help enforce this.\n\nI also need to handle any validation errors gracefully. If there are errors, I'll display them near the respective fields so the user knows what to correct. This means setting up variables to store error messages and checking each field individually.\n\nOnce all validations pass, I should prepare the data for insertion into the database. However, before inserting, it's important to sanitize the inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks. Using mysqli_real_escape_string is a good method for this when using mysqli.\n\nHashing the password is essential for security. I'll use the password_hash function with PASSWORD_DEFAULT as the algorithm and set the cost appropriately. This ensures that the password isn't stored in plain text, which is a major security risk.\n\nNow, about the database connection. I need to include my database credentials\u2014hostname, username, password, and database name. Establishing a connection using mysqli_connect and checking for any connection errors is necessary to prevent issues down the line.\n\nWhen inserting into the database, I should ensure that all columns match the ones in the users table. The query will insert the sanitized full name, email, and hashed password. After executing the query, I'll check if it was successful. If not, I'll handle any errors appropriately, perhaps displaying an error message to the user.\n\nOnce registration is successful, redirecting the user to a login page makes sense. It provides a clear next step and maintains a good user experience.\n\nI should also consider including includes for header and footer files to maintain consistency across pages, but that's more about structure than functionality.\n\nAnother point is preventing duplicate emails in the database. I should check if the email already exists before inserting a new record. This can be done by running a SELECT query on the email field. If a result is found, display an error message indicating the email is already registered.\n\nAdditionally, using prepared statements could enhance security further by preventing SQL injection more effectively than escaping strings. However, for simplicity and given that I'm using mysqli_real_escape_string, maybe it's acceptable for now, but it's something to consider for future improvements.\n\nI should also think about error handling\u2014what if the database connection fails? The script should notify the user or log the error so it can be addressed.\n\nLastly, ensuring that all PHP code is properly enclosed within <?php ?> tags and that variables are correctly named and used throughout the script is important to avoid syntax errors.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the code with form fields, validation checks, database operations, and appropriate redirects or error messages. Testing each part step by step will help catch any issues early on.\n</think>\n\nHere's a user registration function using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\nsession_start();\n\n// Include database configuration file\nrequire_once 'includes/config.php';\nrequire_once 'includes/header.php';\n\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    $errors = array();\n    \n    // Validate full name\n    if (empty($_POST['full_name'])) {\n        $errors[] = \"Full name is required\";\n    } else {\n        $full_name = $_POST['full_name'];\n        // Check if name contains only letters and spaces\n        if (!preg_match(\"/^[a-zA-Z ]+$/\", $full_name)) {\n            $errors[] = \"Full name must contain only letters and spaces\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Validate email\n    if (empty($_POST['email'])) {\n        $errors[] = \"Email is required\";\n    } else {\n        $email = $_POST['email'];\n        // Check if email is valid\n        if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n            $errors[] = \"Invalid email format\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Validate password\n    if (empty($_POST['password'])) {\n        $errors[] = \"Password is required\";\n    } else {\n        $password = $_POST['password'];\n        // Check if password meets criteria: at least 8 characters, contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters\n        if (!preg_match(\"/^(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[^a-zA-Z0-9]).{8,}$/\", $password)) {\n            $errors[] = \"Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If no errors\n    if (empty($errors)) {\n        // Sanitize inputs\n        $full_name = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $full_name);\n        $email = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $email);\n        $password_hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT, array('cost' => 12));\n\n        // Check if email already exists\n        $check_email_query = \"SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = '$email'\";\n        $result = mysqli_query($conn, $check_email_query);\n\n        if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n            $errors[] = \"Email is already registered\";\n        } else {\n            // Insert user into the database\n            $query = \"INSERT INTO users (full_name, email, password) VALUES ('$full_name', '$email', '$password_hash')\";\n            if (mysqli_query($conn, $query)) {\n                // Registration successful\n                header(\"Location: login.php\");\n                exit();\n            } else {\n                // Error occurred\n                $errors[] = \"Error registering user.

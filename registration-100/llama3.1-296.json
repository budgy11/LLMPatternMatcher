The function takes the username, email, and password as arguments, hashes the password, and inserts the new user into the `users` table.\n\nPlease note:\n\n* You'll need to create a `db.php` file that connects to your database.\n* Replace `$pdo` in this example with whatever object you use for your database connection (e.g., PDO or MySQLi).\n* This is a simplified example and may require additional error checking and security measures in a real-world application.\n* Password hashing uses the `password_hash()` function, which generates a random salt each time it's called.\n\nRemember to test this code on your local machine before deploying it.", "code_blocks": ["```php\n<?php\n\nfunction registerUser($username, $email, $password) {\n    // Connect to the database (replace with your own connection method)\n    include 'db.php';\n    \n    try {\n        // Query to insert new user into users table\n        $query = \"INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES (:username, :email, :password)\";\n        \n        $stmt = $pdo->prepare($query);\n        $stmt->bindParam(':username', $username);\n        $stmt->bindParam(':email', $email);\n        $stmt->bindParam(':password', $password);\n\n        // Hash the password before inserting into database\n        $hashedPassword = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n        \n        $stmt->execute();\n        \n        return true; // Return success if user was added successfully\n        \n    } catch (PDOException $e) {\n        echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage(); // If there is an error inserting into database\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {\n    $username = $_POST['username'];\n    $email = $_POST['email'];\n    $password = $_POST['password'];\n\n    if (registerUser($username, $email, $password)) {\n        echo \"User registered successfully!\";\n    } else {\n        echo \"Error registering user.\";\n    }\n}\n?>\n```"]}

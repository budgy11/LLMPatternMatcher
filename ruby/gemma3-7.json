This is excellent object-oriented practice.  It encapsulates the data related to a comment (user, text, timestamp) and provides a way to access it.\n* **`CommentSystem` Class:** This class manages the collection of comments. It keeps track of all comments and provides methods for adding and displaying them.\n* **`add_comment` Method:**  This method creates a new `Comment` object and adds it to the `@comments` array.  It also prints a confirmation message to the console.\n* **`get_all_comments` Method:** This converts the comments array into a more usable format. It returns an array of hashes, where each hash represents a comment with the `user`, `text`, and `timestamp`. This allows you to easily process the comments in other parts of your application.\n* **`display_comments` Method:**  This method iterates through the comments and prints each comment's information in a user-friendly format.\n* **Timestamp:** Includes a timestamp with `Time.now` to record when each comment was added.\n* **Clearer Output:**  The output is now more readable, with labels for the user, text, and timestamp.\n* **Error Handling (implicit):** While this is a simple example, the code handles the case where there are no comments by checking if the `@comments` array is empty before attempting to display them.\n* **Object-Oriented Design:** The code follows good object-oriented principles, making it easier to extend and maintain.\n* **Example Usage:**  The example usage demonstrates how to create a `CommentSystem` object, add comments, and display them.\n\nHow to run the code:\n\n1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.rb` file (e.g., `comment_system.rb`).\n2.  **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, run the file using the command: `ruby comment_system.rb`\n\nThis will execute the code and display the comments to the console.  The `pry` gem is used for debugging.  You can remove it when you're done developing and testing.\n", "code_blocks": ["```ruby\nrequire 'pry'  # For debugging, remove in production\n\nclass Comment\n  attr_reader :user, :text, :timestamp\n\n  def initialize(user, text)\n    @user = user\n    @text = text\n    @timestamp = Time.now\n  end\nend\n\nclass CommentSystem\n  def initialize\n    @comments = []\n  end\n\n  def add_comment(user, text)\n    comment = Comment.new(user, text)\n    @comments << comment\n    puts \"Comment added by #{user} at #{Time.now}\"\n  end\n\n  def get_all_comments\n    @comments.map { |comment| {\n      user: comment.user,\n      text: comment.text,\n      timestamp: comment.timestamp\n    } }\n  end\n\n  def display_comments\n    if @comments.empty?\n      puts \"No comments yet!\"\n    else\n      @comments.each do |comment|\n        puts \"User: #{comment.user}\"\n        puts \"  Text: #{comment.text}\"\n        puts \"  Timestamp: #{comment.timestamp}\"\n        puts \"---\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\n# Example Usage:\n\n# Create a comment system\ncomment_system = CommentSystem.new\n\n# Add some comments\ncomment_system.add_comment(\"Alice\", \"This is a great post!\")\ncomment_system.add_comment(\"Bob\", \"I agree with Alice.\")\ncomment_system.add_comment(\"Charlie\", \"Can you elaborate?\")\n\n# Display all comments\nputs \"All Comments:\"\ncomment_system.display_comments\n\n# Another example with a different user and text\ncomment_system.add_comment(\"David\", \"Awesome!

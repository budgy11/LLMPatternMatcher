This is *crucial* for security.  The example shows how to create a `bcrypt::Password` object. You must install the `bcrypt` gem: `gem install bcrypt`\n* **Token Generation:**  Uses `SecureRandom.hex(16)` to generate a secure random token. The length of 16 is a common starting point and provides sufficient entropy.\n* **Password Reset Link Generation:**  The `generate_reset_link` function constructs the URL with the token and email, making it easy to use.\n* **Email Sending Placeholder:** The `send_email` function is a placeholder.  It's *critical* to replace this with a proper email sending mechanism (e.g., using a service like Mailgun, SendGrid, or ActionMailer in a Rails application).  The placeholder simply prints the email content for demonstration purposes. The example uses the `Mail` library, which is a good way to test email sending locally.\n* **Error Handling (Minimal):**  Checks if the user exists before proceeding. More robust error handling would be needed in a real application (e.g., handling email sending failures, invalid tokens, etc.).\n* **Security Considerations:**\n    * **Token Expiration:**  Implement token expiration to limit the time a user can reset their password.\n    * **Token Uniqueness:**  Ensure that tokens are unique.\n    * **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to protect the reset link from being intercepted.\n    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.\n    * **Secure Storage:**  Do *not* store the raw token or the user's password in plain text.  Use a secure storage mechanism and appropriate encryption.\n* **Example Usage:**  A simple example is provided to show how to call the `forgot_password` function.\n* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The code is organized into functions for clarity and maintainability.\n\n**Important Considerations & Next Steps for Production:**\n\n1. **Email Sending:**  Replace the placeholder `send_email` function with a production-ready email sending library.  Mailgun, SendGrid, and ActionMailer (in Rails) are good options.\n\n2. **Token Storage:**  Store the generated token in a database or session store.  This allows you to verify the token later when the user attempts to reset their password.  Avoid storing the token in plain text.\n\n3. **Token Expiration:** Implement token expiration.  Store a timestamp with the token in the database.  When the user attempts to reset their password with the token, check if the token is still valid (i.e., hasn't expired).\n\n4. **Password Reset Flow:**  Implement the full password reset flow:\n   - User requests a password reset.\n   - A token is generated and stored.\n   - An email is sent with the reset link.\n   - The user clicks the link.\n   - The application verifies the token and the user's new password.\n   - The password is updated in the database.\n\n5. **Validation:**  Add validation to the user's new password (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).\n\n6. **Logging & Monitoring:**  Implement logging and monitoring to track password reset requests and any errors that occur.\n\n7. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the password reset functionality, including edge cases (e.g., expired tokens, invalid tokens, failed email sending).\n\nThis revised response provides a much more robust and secure starting point for implementing a password reset function in Ruby. Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices for handling user credentials.  Always consult with security experts for production environments.\n", "code_blocks": ["```ruby\nrequire 'bcrypt'\nrequire 'mail'\n\n# This is a simplified example and should be adapted for production use.\n# In a real application, you would store passwords securely and handle\n# email sending robustly.\n\nclass User\n  attr_accessor :password_hash, :salt, :email\n\n  def initialize(password, salt, email)\n    @password_hash = bcrypt::Password.create(password, salt)\n    @salt = salt\n    @email = email\n  end\n\n  def verify_password(password)\n    bcrypt::Password.new(@salt) == password\n  end\nend\n\n\ndef forgot_password(email, password)\n  # 1.

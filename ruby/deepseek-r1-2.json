{"prompt": "Create a Content Security Policy that allows S3 bucket content using ruby", "llm_output": "\n\nTo create a Content Security Policy (CSP) for an S3 bucket using Ruby, we will utilize the `lib/csp` library to define security rules. These rules will allow access from trusted domains and restrict unauthorized actions.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. **Define the CSP Class**: Create a class that inherits from `CSP::Policy`. This class will encapsulate the security rules for the S3 bucket.\n\n2. **Initialize Attributes**: In the initializer method, set up any necessary attributes, such as the bucket name required for access.\n\n3. **Add Security Rules**: Use the `add` method to define each rule with its type and parameters:\n   - Deny everything initially.\n   - Allow requests from all domains using GET and DELETE methods.\n   - Restrict file uploads by default unless configured otherwise.\n   - Include common security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options`.\n\n4. **Attach the Policy**: After defining the policy, create an instance of the class and attach it to the S3 bucket's connection.\n\nHere is the Ruby code implementing these steps:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'lib/csp'\n\nclass S3BucketSecurityPolicy < CSP::Policy\n\n  def initialize(bucket_name)\n    super()\n    @bucket_name = bucket_name\n  end\n\n  # Deny everything by default unless allowed explicitly\n  add(\n    Deny.new,\n    [\n      Hosts.new -*>\n        PortRange.new(400..699)\n    ],\n    Headers.new {\n      X-Content-Type-Options => 'nosniff'\n    }\n  )\n\n  # Allow requests from any domain for GET and DELETE\n  add(\n    Allow.new,\n    [\n      Hosts.new -*>\n        PortRange.new(400..699)\n    ],\n    Methods.new ['GET', 'DELETE']\n  )\n\n  # Restrict file uploads unless configured otherwise\n  add(\n    RestrictFileUploads.new,\n    Origins.new [*>]\n  )\nend\n\n# Create the policy instance\npolicy = S3BucketSecurityPolicy.new('your_bucket_name')\n\n# Attach the policy to your S3 bucket's connection\ns3b Buckets.configure(csp: policy)\n```\n\n**Explanation of Each Rule:**\n\n- **Deny Everything**: The initial rule denies access unless explicitly allowed. This includes all domains and ports.\n  \n- **Allow GET and DELETE Requests**: Allows requests from any domain for the `GET` and `DELETE` methods.\n\n- **Restrict File Uploads**: By default, only the bucket owner can upload files to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n- **Common Headers**: The `X-Content-Type-Options` header is set to `nosniff` to prevent sniffing of content types from client side.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- Replace `'your_bucket_name'` with your actual S3 bucket name.\n  \n- Ensure the `s3b` gem or appropriate Ruby client library for S3 is included in your project.\n\nThis setup provides a basic yet secure framework for accessing an S3 bucket, allowing only trusted domains and methods while restricting unauthorized actions.", "code_blocks": ["```ruby\nrequire 'lib/csp'\n\nclass S3BucketSecurityPolicy < CSP::Policy\n\n  def initialize(bucket_name)\n    super()\n    @bucket_name = bucket_name\n  end\n\n  # Deny everything by default unless allowed explicitly\n  add(\n    Deny.new,\n    [\n      Hosts.new -*>\n        PortRange.new(400..699)\n    ],\n    Headers.new {\n      X-Content-Type-Options => 'nosniff'\n    }\n  )\n\n  # Allow requests from any domain for GET and DELETE\n  add(\n    Allow.new,\n    [\n      Hosts.new -*>\n        PortRange.new(400..699)\n    ],\n    Methods.new ['GET', 'DELETE']\n  )\n\n  # Restrict file uploads unless configured otherwise\n  add(\n    RestrictFileUploads.new,\n    Origins.new [*>]\n  )\nend\n\n# Create the policy instance\npolicy = S3BucketSecurityPolicy.new('your_bucket_name')\n\n# Attach the policy to your S3 bucket's connection\ns3b Buckets.configure(csp: policy)\n```"]}

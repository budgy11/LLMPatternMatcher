{"prompt": "Create a reset password function using ruby", "llm_output": "\n\nHere's a Ruby function to create and send a password reset email using the Mandrill email API:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'mailer'\nrequire 'mandrill'\n\ndef reset_password(user_data, token)\n  # Extract user details from user_data array\n  email = user_data[0]\n  current_password = user_data[1]\n\n  # Construct subject line and email body\n  reset_email_contents = [\n    \"Subject: Your Password Reset Request\",\n    \n    \"Dear #{email},\\n\\n\"\n    \"We hope this email finds you well.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Unfortunately, your account password has been forgotten.\\n\\n\",\n    \n    \"To reset your password, please visit the link below and enter your security token:\\n\\n\"\n    \"https://your-website.com/reset_password?token=#{token}\\n\\n\",\n    \n    \"Once you complete the password reset process, you will receive a confirmation email.\\n\\n\",\n    \"If you did not request this email in your spam folder, please check there and click 'Mark as Not Spammed'.\\n\\n\",\n    \"If you have already used this link to reset your password previously, please proceed carefully.\\n\\n\",\n    \"If you believe this email is a scam, please contact us at support@your-website.com.\\n\\n\",\n    \"Thank you for trusting us with your account.\",\n  ]\n\n  # Send the reset email\n  mailer.send(\n    from: 'support@your-website.com',\n    to: [email],\n    subject: reset_email_contents[0],\n    text: reset_email_contents.join('\\n'),\n  )\n\n  # Confirmation message after password reset (optional)\n  post_reset_email = \"Password Reset Confirmation:\\nYou have successfully reset your password.\\nOur system has already been updated with this information.\"\n\n  mailer.send(\n    from: 'support@your-website.com',\n    to: [email],\n    subject: 'Password Reset Confirmed',\n    text: post_reset_email,\n  )\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation of the code:**\n\n1. **Email Construction:**\n   - The function constructs a password reset email with all necessary details, including:\n     - A specific subject line\n     - Personalized greeting to the user's email address\n     - Link to reset the password using the security token\n     - Instructions for the user after completing the reset process\n\n2. **Mandrill API:**\n   - The Mandrill Ruby SDK is used to send emails from your application.\n   - You need to replace `'support@your-website.com'` with your actual email address or use an anonymous sender.\n\n3. **Parameters:**\n   - `user_data`: An array containing the user's details, such as `[email, password]`.\n   - `token`: The security token provided by the user after clicking the reset link.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```ruby\n# Sample user data and token\nuser_data = [\"john.doe@example.com\", \"abcd1234\"]\ntoken = \"sec_token_123\"\n\n# Call the function to send password reset email\nreset_password(user_data, token)\n```\n\n**Optional: Confirmation Email After Reset**\n\nAfter sending the initial reset email, an additional confirmation email is sent to the user to confirm that their password has been updated. This helps prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- Make sure to replace placeholders like `'support@your-website.com'` with your actual email address.\n- The Mandrill API keys and configuration details should be properly set up in your `.env` file or according to your API provider's requirements.\n\nThis function provides a comprehensive approach to sending password reset emails, including proper handling of cases where the email might not have been delivered due to being caught in the spam folder.", "code_blocks": ["```ruby\nrequire 'mailer'\nrequire 'mandrill'\n\ndef reset_password(user_data, token)\n  # Extract user details from user_data array\n  email = user_data[0]\n  current_password = user_data[1]\n\n  # Construct subject line and email body\n  reset_email_contents = [\n    \"Subject: Your Password Reset Request\",\n    \n    \"Dear #{email},\\n\\n\"\n    \"We hope this email finds you well.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Unfortunately, your account password has been forgotten.\\n\\n\",\n    \n    \"To reset your password, please visit the link below and enter your security token:\\n\\n\"\n    \"https://your-website.com/reset_password?token=#{token}\\n\\n\",\n    \n    \"Once you complete the password reset process, you will receive a confirmation email.\\n\\n\",\n    \"If you did not request this email in your spam folder, please check there and click 'Mark as Not Spammed'.\\n\\n\",\n    \"If you have already used this link to reset your password previously, please proceed carefully.\\n\\n\",\n    \"If you believe this email is a scam, please contact us at support@your-website.com.\\n\\n\",\n    \"Thank you for trusting us with your account.\",\n  ]\n\n  # Send the reset email\n  mailer.send(\n    from: 'support@your-website.com',\n    to: [email],\n    subject: reset_email_contents[0],\n    text: reset_email_contents.join('\\n'),\n  )\n\n  # Confirmation message after password reset (optional)\n  post_reset_email = \"Password Reset Confirmation:\\nYou have successfully reset your password.\\nOur system has already been updated with this information.\"\n\n  mailer.send(\n    from: 'support@your-website.com',\n    to: [email],\n    subject: 'Password Reset Confirmed',\n    text: post_reset_email,\n  )\nend\n```", "```ruby\n# Sample user data and token\nuser_data = [\"john.doe@example.com\", \"abcd1234\"]\ntoken = \"sec_token_123\"\n\n# Call the function to send password reset email\nreset_password(user_data, token)\n```"]}

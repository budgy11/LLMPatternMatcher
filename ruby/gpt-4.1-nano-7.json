{"prompt": "Create a function to allow users to comment using ruby", "llm_output": "Certainly! Here's a simple example of how you could create a basic Ruby class to handle user comments. This example will include methods to add comments and display all comments.\n\n```ruby\nclass CommentSection\n  def initialize\n    @comments = []\n  end\n\n  # Method to add a comment\n  def add_comment(user, message)\n    @comments << { user: user, message: message, timestamp: Time.now }\n  end\n\n  # Method to display all comments\n  def display_comments\n    if @comments.empty?\n      puts \"No comments yet.\"\n    else\n      @comments.each_with_index do |comment, index|\n        puts \"#{index + 1}. #{comment[:user]} (#{comment[:timestamp]}):\"\n        puts \"   #{comment[:message]}\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ncomments = CommentSection.new\ncomments.add_comment(\"Alice\", \"This is a great post!\")\ncomments.add_comment(\"Bob\", \"Thanks for sharing.\")\n\ncomments.display_comments\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- `CommentSection` class maintains a list of comments.\n- `add_comment(user, message)` adds a new comment with the current timestamp.\n- `display_comments` prints out all comments with their respective users and timestamps.\n\nYou can expand this basic structure to include more features like comment validation, deletion, or persistence to a database as needed. Let me know if you'd like a more advanced version!", "code_blocks": ["```ruby\nclass CommentSection\n  def initialize\n    @comments = []\n  end\n\n  # Method to add a comment\n  def add_comment(user, message)\n    @comments << { user: user, message: message, timestamp: Time.now }\n  end\n\n  # Method to display all comments\n  def display_comments\n    if @comments.empty?\n      puts \"No comments yet.\"\n    else\n      @comments.each_with_index do |comment, index|\n        puts \"#{index + 1}. #{comment[:user]} (#{comment[:timestamp]}):\"\n        puts \"   #{comment[:message]}\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ncomments = CommentSection.new\ncomments.add_comment(\"Alice\", \"This is a great post!\")\ncomments.add_comment(\"Bob\", \"Thanks for sharing.\")\n\ncomments.display_comments\n```"]}
